1gd6f0u,"watsons experience I usually just experience sales people following me around whenever I’m at Watsons.

But today, I dropped by to get some essentials and decided to check out some makeup so I can test it out whether I should purchase it or not.

I stumbled upon Issy’s stall. I saw their new releases, and even tried it out. Not gonna lie, I was almost going to buy it kasi maganda yung product. What made me not purchase it is the salesperson—she approached me and said “Ayan ma’am bagong labas po namin yan, sakto nagmamantika na face mo”

They really have the tendency to point out things they shouldn’t. Sobrang na off ako kasi I know my face isn’t oily that time but my skin just has that “natural glow” because of the skin prep I did and I didn’t wear any base product.

Next, I went to BLK’s stall. I was checking out their new skin tint. I was swatching the shades to see which one matches me the best. It was nice too! The reason why I didn’t buy? The salesperson kept saying “Ano ma’am okay na?” “Okay na ba ma’am?” I told her I’ll wait for it to set, go around first and check if it doesn’t oxidize. I went to the other side of their stall and she followed me then said “Ayan ma’am ok na? Umikot ka na po, mas maayos na ilaw” “Kunin niyo na po?”

While I understand they need sales, with their approach towards customers won’t allow them to sell anything especially if you’re like me na ayaw kinukulit or ayaw pinepressure when you’re checking out a product.

I think Watsons should train their people again kasi so far, I’d rather look for physical stores ng local brands na wala sa Watsons or just really take the risk and buy online.",https://www.reddit.com/r/beautytalkph/comments/1gd6f0u/watsons_experience/,3044,543,Discussion,"blk, issy","local, local","skin tint, makeup",,2024-10-27,Negative
1hyn57z,"a guide to local fashion brands if your 2025 goal is to shop local or choose more sustainable options for clothing, then this is the post for you! i've started compiling a list of local clothing brands ranging from casual to formal to activewear, including categories for shoes and bags. after perusing this forum (and r/fashionph) and finding not much information on local brands to support, i decided to start this list by listing down the brands often mentioned in these posts and including a link where to find them, along with a short blurb about the brand or what they sell.

as always, consuming less or secondhand is always better, but should you find the need to purchase, maybe try out something from this list!

1j6ld7d,"My acne journey July last year, I had severe acne breakout. I was brought to a dermatologist (she’s famous on tiktok and also on this sub, but kinda not in a good way haha) and it was diagnosed as adult acne. I remember not having this kind of breakout in my teenage years but I didn’t really expect it to occur in my 30s. 

I was prescribed to take isotretinion, an Everwhite soap and Everwhite sunblock. The oral med really did wonders, it healed my acne and cleared my face. The soap is okay but the sunblock is a struggle to apply. It is very thick and kind of drying. So while I was still on isotret, I switched back to the skincare products I used prior which are: Cosrx Good Morning gentle cleanser, Cosrx Advance Snail Mucin & Cosrx Aloevera soothing gel sunscreen. These products were a great help para mas lalong mag-heal ang skin ko.

I only took 180 capsules of isotret in total. 90 caps for one month and a half, after that, blood testing to ensure your liver/kidney is okay (I did blood testing before taking too) then 90 caps again for another month and a half. I was supposed to take another round pa but after my 2nd round of taking it, hindi na ako bumalik sa derma kasi parang wala naman siyang pake haha plus my face has totally cleared na rin so I thought it was okay to stop. 

So far, I don’t get pimples anymore, even during my period, as in wala na talaga. Though I was left with some stubborn acne marks and may mga pitted scars din. I do hope they will disappear overtime. My current skincare routine includes:

AM: Hada Labo Shirojyun cleanser - Hada Labo Shirojyun lotion - CC Melano Vitamin C - Skinoren Azelaic acid - Skin Aqua moisture sunscreen

PM: Cosrx Salicylic acid cleanser - Hada Labo Shirojyun lotion - Skinoren - Olay Regenerist retinol - Bioten moisturizer - Vaseline lip care therapy for my lips

Last two photos, I had minimal makeup on. Slowly introducing myself into makeup too. 

Products used: 

Stokes Veil filter foundation in shade medium 003

House of hur ampoule blusher in shade cherry blossom 
 
Vice Co brontour in push 

Kiko Milano lip crayon shade pink mauve

1jjf3m9,"I don't want to gatekeep, for oily girls out there! Whoever suggested this, thank you! Finally, found a product that keeps me matte all day. Hindi na shiny, no need for blotting paper, and still looks fresh at the end of the day (lalo na sa mga photos, I no longer look like hulas). Laneige Neo Essential Blurring Powder. 

For context, I get oily 1-2 hours after applying my makeup. I have tried adding a mattifying primer to my routine pero no change pa rin. I have also tried the loose setting powder from Mac pero wala pa rin. Tried not using a moisturizer (just my sunscreen) pero shiny pa rin. Tried switching my sunscreen to the gold Anessa (which they sais is recommended for oily skin) pero shiny pa rin. 

Eto lang pala ang makakapagmatte sa face ko. I use it to set my liquid foundation. Since using this I no longer need to touch up my makeup. Hindi na rin ako gumagamit ng blotting paper. Don't be scared of the white powder, it won't affect your makeup. And totoong nakakablur sya. I use a brush to apply it, mas nacocontrol ko kasi yung amount ng powder compared pag puff. 

BONUS: I am on tretinoin and it does not emphasize my flaky skin. Pores on my nose are not emphasized too compared to other powders. 

TIP: Hold your breath when applying this. The powder is too fine makikita mo talaga na may lumilipad sa air. ",https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jjf3m9,2215,224,Review,"mac, laneige","international, international","foundation, primer, powder, powders, brush, moisturizer, makeup",,2025-03-25,Positive
1dbxqd9,"skin care journey — from breakouts malala to decent skin timeline: august 2023 - may 2024

as you can see in the pictures, I had really bad acne — super bad na I cant smile or move my face without my cheeks hurting from them. 

additional context: I was eating healthy and was sleeping at least 6 hours per day. I was drinking minimum of 128oz of water every day and I was active (5km every day). Sometimes, it’s not the food or lifestyle of the person. Sadyang f*cked up lang hormones ng tao minsan + genetics pa.

my skin care routine before I broke out:
- hada labo face wash
- skin1004 cleansing oil
- skin1004 centelle asiatica suncreen (the viral one)
- hada labo premium lotion (toner)
- dermorepubliq 
- la roche posay cicaplast baume
- la roche posay sunscreen

I recently started double cleansing lang niyan, and imo that’s what caused me to break out. When I noticed na di na normal yung tumutubong acne ko, I stopped double cleansing immediately but I think na damage ko na skin barrier ko by then (over stripped d skin).

Here’s what I did/products that helped clear my skin:
- skin1004 ampoule face wash
- PR (papa reciple) enzyme powder wash
- Numbuzin no. 1 toner
- PR blemish serum
- PR blemish cream/moisturizer
- PR Mild derma sunscreen 

Then when I felt like my skin barrier is okay na, I incorporated/switched the following:
- +ful vitamin c serum
- +ful sunscreen
- Good molecules retinol 
- Saipo moisturizer 
- La roche posay cicaplast baume

Currently though, I simplified my routine na.
- Morning routine: wash with water only, toner, vitamin c and sunscreen na lang
- Night routine: cleanser, retinol, moisturizer, la roche posay cicaplast (twice a week)

yun lang HAHA i hope this post can help someone! personally, ang hirap kasi magkaron ng confidence/magayos ng sarili kapag anlala ng acne 🥹. Also please take every advice with a grain of salt po! Ngl, nabudol ako before sa products and routine pero that just made it worsen, what worked for me was listening to my skin and curating a routine based on what I need.

Tips on how to use it;

*I usually mix this oil with my vaseline gluta hya lotion  after shower. Nakaka help sya para mag-lighten ang skin spe cially mga dark spots or kahit old peklat.  
*Ina-apply ko din sya straight on my face, it helps to hydrate the dry patches and it can remove stubborn make up.
*For UA it helps to improve the chicken skin, prevent irritation. Also sa bikini area, apply it before and after bath, 2 pumps is good na. 
*And pwede sya overall body moisturizer. Hindi sya malagkit sa balat kahit mainit.

Using it for a year now, legit ang 25 miracles nito mga sissy! 💯

1e600ng,"Impressed with a Miniso Product  SKL. I have been purchasing plenty of stuff from Miniso like their charging cables(long lasting) wet wipes, cotton pads, and dry tissues but this item I'm sharing with you today takes the cake!

So I've had this vent hairbrush for several months now and I just had to rave about it. I bought it from Miniso for Php 199. I initially got attracted to it because of its vent design kasi mas madali linisin than your ordinary hairbrush. I have to admit,  I've tossed plenty of good hairbrushes because I'm too lazy to really deep clean them. Although vent hairbrushes are mainly used for blow drying, you have to admit na dual purpose ito.

THAT'S NOT THE BEST PART! At the bottom part of the handle, is a plastic part that you can easily unsnap with your fingernail to reveal a hook to clean your hairbrush!

Nilagyan ko na rin ng hair tie and two bobby pins to make use of the space inside the hollow part of the handle.

Anyway, I know mababaw lang ito but I'm just really happy about it. Planning to buy again the next time I go to Miniso para may back up just in case.",https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1e600ng,1456,111,Hair,miniso,local,"brush, brushes",,2024-07-18,Positive
1gnx5bl,"jan 2021 vs. nov 2024 was browsing thru my gallery and realized na ang layo na pala ng pinanggalingan ko 🥹 the before photo was due to a FAKE TO NIACINAMIDE product which i continued using for 3-4 weeks because i thought i was just purging. this decision caused the worst acne breakout of my life and i consulted with a derma after two months of no improvement after stopping product usage.

i was prescribed with the ff. (take note that you CANNOT buy these OTC; please consult with a derma for a proper diagnosis + prescriptions):

* **epiduo gel (HG ⭐)** \- dried out almost all my acne within a month of usage. only used up two bottles (around 4-5 months) and then since nawala na acne ko, i stopped na.
* **doxycycline (oral)** \- stopped after two weeks because i had a mild allergic reaction to it

epiduo and cleanser (neutrogena ultra gentle hydrating cleanser) lang yung ginamit ko for a month. after the acne dried out, i started my skincare journey of finding what products to use for the hyperpigmentation it left behind + other issues.

i'm oily/combi & acne-prone. my skin conditions fluctuate due to hormones (as a diagnosed pcos girly), so even when i use products which i consider are my HGs, minsan nagkaka-break out pa rin ako no matter what.

🌻 **products i have tried so far (YMMV!):**

🌸 CLEANSERS

* **neutrogena ultra gentle hydrating cleanser** \- VERY VERY GENTLE & does the job + i didn't break out. it does not lather up, so i wouldn't recommend this if you prefer foaming cleansers. WR
* **nature republic cleansing foam** \- made my face squeaky clean, but may tight feeling afterwards. WNR
* **cosrx low ph good morning gel cleanser** \- ok lang. it was really good sa simula, but i changed bc i think after a while, it made my skin a bit too dry + flaky. WNR
* **cosrx salicylic acid cleanser** \- personally this was too drying for me :( WNR
* **etude house baking powder cleansing foam** \- helps take off stubborn makeup but my skin feels tight afterward + i don't like the feeling of the small beads/scrub :( i use only very little of this lang kapag i feel like i have too much gunk on my face. WNR
* **panoxyl 4% (HG ⭐)** \- been using this for 8 months na bc it's AMAZING for keeping acne at bay. i use this for backne and my underarms too--i don't use deo na because wala akong BO ever since i started using it for my UA too! very drying though, so i recommend pairing it with a good moisturizer afterwards.

🌸 TONERS

* **face republic ph-balancing toner** \- caused little bumps :( think i bought this because of a discount. WNR
* **dokdo toner** \- very gentle and hydrating!! would recommend kasi wala talaga siyang adverse effects for me, though i understand if people find it a bit too mild
* **axis-y daily purifying toner (HG ⭐)** \- finished two bottles of this!! i think ito yung super nakatulong sa hyperpigmentation and acne ko after i stopped using epiduo! plus it didn't dry me out or anything. WR
* **cosrx aha/bha clarifying treatment toner** \- no effect on me. WNR
* **tonymoly wonder ceramide mocchi toner** \- made me break out :( WNR

🌸 SUNSCREENS

* **fairy skin premium brightening sunscreen** \- may slight whitecast, but i never broke out using this. not at the top of my list, pero not at the bottom either
* **biore uv aqua rich watery essence** \- no whitecast, dewy finish, didn't break out. WR
* **luxe organix aqua daily sunscreen** \- slight whitecast, dewy finish, also didn't break out. i liked this because it's such a steal for its price!! i stopped using it lang because it turned my white fabrics into yellow
* **omi menturm sun bears gold active protect milk (HG ⭐)** \- absolute bang for the buck for me - matte finish and it didn't break me out!!! helps control sebum + the small 30g bottle lasts me like 3-4 months. the cons include having a slight whitecast and you have to shake it well to get the right consistency. personally can't recommend this enough though, WR

🌸 SERUMS/ACNE TREATMENT/OTHERS

* **skin by bys brightening serum** \- it did boost my skin's brightness a little bit? naubos ko naman yung bottle and i didn't break out using it so this one is so-so
* **axis-y dark spot correcting glow serum** \- ang daming good reviews nito but i personally didn't see any changes/improvement even after i finished like 90% of the product :( WNR
* **cosrx advanced snail mucin** \- bought it because of the hype. this does nothing for me; i think it's meant to be paired with moisturizer or something hydrating pero since i use neither, i don't really see a difference. WNR
* **seek space micronized benzoyl peroxide 2.5%** \- bought it as spot treatment for acne, didn't really do anything. WNR
* **skinfx adap+benz 0.1% + 2.5%** \- also bought this as spot treatment. no visible effects for me, WNR
* **bcp tretinoin 0.05%** \- helped keep my acne at bay :) finished a tube then stopped kasi i wanted to try other brands/routines. WR
* **dermcare retinyl** \- vv gentle alternative to retinol (since it's a retinol derivative)! i think it helped my skin with acne control and hyperpigmentation. super cheap for the amount na you're getting din, so WR!!

🌻 **currently, my routine is:**

AM:

* i just wash my face with water nalang in the morning (my skin feels too oily lately; i think my skin barrier is damaged & i'm trying to rebuild it)
* **hada labo premium whitening toner (lotion)** \- trying this out palang. slightly sticky after applying but okay naman siya after a while. i did notice my skin become brighter after a while, pero baka delulu lang ako
* **canmake mermaid skin gel uv (clear)** \- no whitecast. would recommend for girlies who like a dewy finish!

PM:

* **hada labo premium whitening cleanser** \- trying it out palang too. so far, it feels gentle naman + walang tight feeling after using
* **hada labo premium whitening toner (lotion)**
* **axis-y dark spot correcting glow serum** \- been using this for 4 months na kasi nirecommend ng derma ko for acne marks, but i don't think may effect ito sa skin ko. inuubos ko lang siya kasi ang mahal hahaha

1dy62yb,"sunnies is only for the ✨rich🌟 here’s my controversial take on sunnies but let me know if im just over analyzing the brand

napaisip ako about the recent issue about their blush on and here are my thoughts.

sunnies never wanted to be known as a local filipino brand. their goal is to be known internationally, and maybe there’s nothing wrong with it. alam naman natin na there’s barely filipino representation sa mga campaigns nila. and if meron it’s usually the mestizas or who fits in their branding. i feel like their target market in the local market are the upper-middle class to upper class. yung mga girls who don’t commute and have to deal with the philippine humid weather. yung mga hindi pinapawisan or nahahaggard like me. kaya medyong hindi rin reliable yung wear test kasi iba iba naman activites natin. if busy full day sympre baka di long lasting. i tried their blush on kasi ang kapag nagaangkas ako nawawala siya lol. but siguro if ur someone na laging naka aircon or has a car it won’t be a issue for you.

that’s why i don’t buy from sunnies na cuz my lifestyle does not meet the quality of their products and thats the hard truth. i also dont wanna support a brand who doesnt take account ng need ng local audience nila. meron ako befor ng airblush, skin so good, lip dip and etc tapos parang 30 mins max need na retouch. even yung first mascara (lash lift) na linabas nila wasnt made for your typical filipino kasi sino naman yung may gusto ng hindi water proof na mascara in this weather? or maybe they just can’t relate to some of their customers since yung mismong owners live comfortable lives. like if you compare it with GRWM cosmetics sinabi na mismo ni Mae na target talaga nila is filipinos and taken account yung weather also while commuting or going around the ph heat. 

to end, maybe it’s also part of their marketing na parang there’s exclusivity vibes and you wanna be part of the sunnies girls haha. but for me it won’t work na since madami naman other good local brands instead!

edit: to add, they only have ~filipino pride~ when it's under their advantage. parang user vibes kasi obviously majority of their buyers are filipinos naman yet they always seem to have a distance to it. pansin ko sa mga local beauty influencers they would post nga the reviews on their page but its to drive sales & hype to their products ",https://www.reddit.com/r/beautytalkph/comments/1dy62yb/sunnies_is_only_for_the_rich/,1399,321,Discussion,"sunnies, grwm","local, local","blush, mascara, lash",,2024-07-08,Neutral
1ly5xzx,"simple pride makeup I did for Komiket Pride!🌈✨ I know it's mid-July already, but I keep forgetting to post this FOTD on the weekends lol. Makeup inspo is on the last slide.

**PRODUCTS USED**

1. **Issy Active Skin Tint** (Fawn) - This is the only base makeup I own, and I'm pretty satisfied. I don't really use base makeup often, but when I do, this is really good! Not too thick, but still evens out my skin tone. I prefer a dewy finish and this definitely gives that! Would repurchase.
2. **Issy Active Concealer** (PL2) - The only concealer I've ever used. Doesn't crease, moisturizing, perfect for the under eyes. A peach corrector is all I need for my dark under eyes, and this does a good job of color correcting. Would repurchase.
3. **GRWM Milk Tint** (Pudding) - Been using this blush for years and I still haven't run out lmao. Long-lasting, especially when you set it properly. I prefer applying this with a dense brush, and it blends out pretty well. Would repurchase, but I so also want to try out other liquid blushes/water tints. (lmk if u have recos!)
4. **Vice Cosmetics One & Done Stick** (Society) - Good cream highlighter. It does the job. Easy to use, I like to tap it on the high points of my face with my fingers. Super nice dewy highlight. I don't think it lasts long enough, though. Would not repurchase, I just feel like there are probably better highlighters out there. I've since tried the Cezanne Pearl Glow Highlight, which is a powder, but I prefer it more. It also lasts longer.
5. **Peripera Sunshine Cheek** (01 Calm Pink) - The only powder blush I own. It's fine. It's a cute color and the pigment is subtle but buildable, which I like since I'm always scared I'll put too much on. There isn't any fall out either. Would repurchase, but I do think there are probably better powder blushes out there to try. This one is good and affordable,
6. **Romand Juicy Lasting Tint** (02 Nucadamia - *New Formula*) - I also own the old Nucadamia and I definitely prefer this over the old formulation. Although I do feel like the shades are brighter than the old ones. I prefer a more muted nude, and this is just a little too bright. But the old formula's scent just bothers me so much that I'd rather use this. It does look really nice and glossy, but you really do have to avoid smacking your lips to maintain that nice shine. Would not repurchase, I'd rather try the Peripera Ink Mood Glowy Tints.
7. **Detail Cosmetics Superfine Liner** (Latte) - Great brow pencil! It's the perfect shade for me. Works really well and is easy to use. The really thin tip makes drawing hair strokes really easy. (I will admit though, I'm bad at doing my brows, so I might not be doing it justice lmao sorryyy.) Would repurchase.
8. **GRWM Life-Proof Fixing Spray** (Radiant Finish) - Bought it the first time it went on sale. It does a good job of setting my makeup all day, but I do think makeup still smudges a little if you touch your face a lot (which I do lmao). The mister is good. Gives a nice fine spray, just make sure you wipe the nozzle off after every couple uses. Would repurchase.
9. **Issy Eyeshadow Singles** (Metamorphosis) - only used one shade from my palette for this look. I always rave their shimmers and duochromes. They're so creamy and pigmented. The payoff is insane. They're great toppers or just on their own. Would repurchase, and purchase more shades!
10. **Beauty Glazed Color Twist** \- Idk if these are still available. I just got this from the orange app for less than 600 pesos. This is great value if you want to do colorful looks! The mattes aren't super pigmented but if you use an eyeshadow base (I use the one from Issy), they work well enough! For this look though, I only used shimmers. (Shades I used are marked with 🖤 in the 5th slide.) I definitely like the shimmers more than the mattes on this palette. The color payoff is better, and the glitters are super pretty. Wouldn't repurchase, but I think it's great for beginners!

1g0d1xu,"I tried 10 different sunscreens. Here is my review Here is a list of the sunscreens I have used so far, ranked from worst to best, along with prices (which might be inaccurate since it's been a while for some products, and I got some of it on a sale) and a brief review for each product. For context, my skin type is sensitive, combination, and acne-prone. I have active pimples and acne scars. 

* Cetaphil Sun SPF 50+ Light Gel (₱800-900): 2/10
Despite its claims of being ""lightweight,"" it didn’t feel lightweight at all. You can definitely feel it on your face. I also found it greasy, and it leaves a minimal white cast.

* Suncelle Sunscreen Facial Moisturizer SPF 40 (₱200-300?): 2/10
Given the price, I didn’t expect much. It felt greasy and oily, so I only used it on my arms. I bought it at a convenience store because I forgot to bring my usual sunscreen. Minimal white cast.

* Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Dry-Touch SPF 50+ (₱600-700): 5/10
This could have been perfect if it didn’t sting my face. I feel like the formula is too strong for those with a sensitive or damaged skin barrier like mine. It lives up to its ""dry-touch"" and lightweight claims, but it dries so fast that it's hard to blend evenly. No white cast.

* Mediheal Tea Tree Moisture Sun Cream & Hyaluronate Moisture Sun Cream SPF 50+ (Free samples): 5/10
I’m combining my review for these sunscreens since they have almost the same formula. Both are lightweight with a watery texture that I usually like in a daily sunscreen. However, they gave me a stinging sensation, especially around my upper lip. It was so bad that I had to remove them. I almost bought this, but I didn't since I decided to try the free samples first. I only used these 2-3 times.

* SKIN1004 Madagascar Centella Air-Fit Suncream Plus (₱400-500): 6/10
I bought this after being recommended to try a physical sunscreen for my skin type. It has a slight tint and creamy texture. While it claims to be lightweight and suited for sensitive skin, I still felt a bit of stinging. The formula isn’t greasy despite being a cream, but my skin becomes oily when I use this. It has an earthy smell, which some might not like. Minimal white cast.

* SKIN1004 Madagascar Centella Hyalu-Cica Water-Fit Sun Serum SPF 50+ (₱500-600): 5/10
I only inserted a picture of it above, I might have thrown out the container. I think this wasn’t just suitable for my skin type. I experienced the same stinging sensation around my upper lip and on active pimples. The watery formula leaves no white cast.

Now, onto the sunscreens that worked for me:

* Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Watery Sun Gel SPF 50+ (₱600-800): 7/10
This is my newest sunscreen, and it has worked well for me so far. I’ve been using it for only a week, but I already know I’ll repurchase it. I love the watery gel formula—it’s lightweight, easy to apply, non-greasy, and doesn’t make my skin oily. No stinging or fragrance, and it leaves a dewy finish, which I prefer over a matte finish that accentuates dry patches. Rating it only a 7, since I have not really used this a lot to give a final verdict.

* Skintific 5X Ceramide Serum Sunscreen SPF 50+ (₱300-400): 8/10
Ceramides and hyaluronic acid always work well for my skin, and this product contains both. The formula is lightweight, slightly watery despite being a cream-type sunscreen, and it absorbs quickly. When I use this, I don’t need a separate moisturizer. However, it does make my skin a little oily, but I don’t mind because I love how it feels when I apply it on my skin. 

* Fairy Skin Premium Brightening Sunscreen SPF 50+ PA++++ (₱250-350): 9/10
MY HOLY GRAIL AND FAVORITE SUNSCREEN EVER! It has everything I want: a watery-gel formula, no stinging, blendable, non-greasy, fast-absorbing, with a brightening and glass-skin effect. It’s also affordable. Even when I apply multiple layers, it doesn’t feel oily or greasy. While the ingredients suggest it’s a physical sunscreen, the texture is more like a chemical sunscreen. The only thing I’m unsure about is whether it’s truly tested for broad-spectrum protection. I also use a moisturizer with it, as it’s not as hydrating as Skintific, but I love how it feels on my skin.

Now, I plan to rotate the sunscreens that worked for me so my skin won’t build tolerance. 

I gave the sunscreens that didn’t work to my mom, so nothing is wasted :)

1lbseoq,"dusting powder routine🪻 i see a lot of body care threads but haven’t read any discussion about using dusting powders and integrating that into our body care. what are your thoughts about it? 



ang dami ko kasing nakikita dati about dusting powder being a staple in poc women’s hygiene and self-care routines, especially re: how it can make you smell better whoooole day long [see pic 1 for reference about what i’m talking about]. so i recently integrated it in my own routine and GOD i noticed na I DO SMELL GOOD all day long! tipong kumakapit talaga lalo perfume ko kahit napawisan na doing errands for work or at home. plus ang presko pa sa pakiramdam. 

since starting pa lang ako sa ganitong routine and haven’t done deeper research on products available sa atin, i’m only using baby powders and perfumed powders accessible sa supermarkets - johnson’s baby baby blossoms and lavender powders + enchanted romantic and alluring powders 😂 i just sprinkle them all over my chest, shoulders, underboobs, entire back, and legs - depende on what i’m wearing for the day. i’ve been meaning to buy a container and a huge puff to make this an easier daily thing para pat pat nalang all over the body at para less messy. 

this is the sequence of my routine:

shower > facial skincare > body lotion + body oil > dusting powder > perfume 

i pair my dusting powder with my signature scents (jo malone’s peony & blush suede or wood sage & sea salt / carolina herrera’s good girl / givenchy l’interdit). 

i’m looking into improving my dusting powder skills and routine, like exploring other powders and concocting different blends of powders and scents with other perfumes!

1j45zp3,"♡ my new favorite clinic ♡ Okay, I wish you all knew how I’ve been on this lowkey obsessive hunt for an aesthetic clinic where the actual doctor — not the senior nurse, not the “head aesthetician,” but a real licensed doctor — handles the treatments. Nothing against aestheticians, but if someone’s injecting something into my face, I want someone who can legally write me a prescription if things go south. That’s just my standard.

So, I found this gem — **SkinKosi Medical Aesthetics**, located near Robinsons Manila — and girl, let me just say, I walked in skeptical (because they don't have much social media presence) and walked out pleasantly surprised.

First off, they made me fill out a Google form for their patients records — *actual patient records* not just some half-baked skin survey slash records with checkbox treatment list at the bottom where they will usually try to tick and match you to a promo package. It’s a small thing, but it instantly made me feel like they take things seriously. Green flag agad ganern. 

Now, let’s talk about the consultation — because it wasn’t the usual 5-minute “so ano po papagawa natin today?” It was a full-on 45 minutes assessment of what you want changed and what she recommends, and it was clear the doctor wasn’t there to rush me out the door. 

I had questions (*so many questions, TOO many questions*), and she answered everything without making me feel like I was overthinking — even though I absolutely was. And here’s the kicker — she actually discouraged me and told me *not* to get some of the treatments I was already mentally budgeting for. She straight up said I didn’t need them or it will not fit me. I know the bar is on the floor but I really appreciate that they're actually actively looking out for you and your face. 

Another thing that stood out — SHE DOES EVERYTHING. No assistants swooping in halfway. She even put on my hair cap herself, (*why am I so touched by this???*) felt like your favorite tita fixing your hair before photos 😅 The entire time, I was really nervyy and I felt like she noticed cause she kept on asking if it was painful (spoiler: i was just *very nervous,* i'm brave until I’m not aka i just a baby sometimes) This was also the part where she was setting expectations, like when to see results, if it's instant or not, etc.  

The topical anesthesia had to sit for about 30-45 minutes, no complaints though, as I said I expected it already as I've been watching **too many tiktok videos** about it so I brought my kindle with me. 

We did HIFU to 'boost collagen' (*this is what i told my mom hahaha*) and, most importantly, to deal with my fluffy face — because, as always, my face likes to be the first to gain weight. It’s giving *POCHI*, and though I love my pochi cheeks, she needs to chill sometimes. 

And can I just say — for the first time in forever, I saw my pointy chin again. My cute little chin that’s been hiding under my fluff for way too long. She’s back, baby. :p

Then we did jaw tox to help with my TMJ and my very (un)sexy stress habit of grinding my teeth. She walked me through everything, even pointing out how my right cheek’s a bit puffier than my left when we did HIFU (felt so seen, but okay), and she adjusted the shots to balance it out. Every step, even every move from cheeks area to chin, she'd explain it and she does it so well. 

The Hifu itself felt nothing. I was fully bracing for even the tiniest zap or warmth, but nope — nada. Either my pain tolerance is secretly elite, or her technique is just that good. I’m betting on the latter.

The jaw tox took maybe 5 minutes tops, because of her super light hands which I joked about a lot during the consult, I said ayaw ko ng mabigat kamay. Then once we were done, she gave me the usual aftercare spiel, like no hot showers, 'wag heavy workout muna, etc, but the part I really appreciated? She actually told me to tell her if I am not satisfied. 

And that if after 2 weeks I didn’t like how the jaw botox settled, I could come back and she’d adjust it — no other bs. That’s really rare in this industry, esp I have places that would make you feel bad for even thinking of coming back, or even complaining if youre unsatisifed. 

Now, to the only minor downside? Parking. When I arrived, I had to wait around 5 minutes because someone blocked the spot. Not a huge deal, but if you’re the type who plans everything down to the minute and mentally schedules your every move (aka me), and if you’re a “I need everything to move smoothly or my entire mood will shift” type (again, me), just something to mentally prep for. Anyway, not really an issue if you don't drive, or just book a grab. 

Overall? I paid for everything myself (OFC — my wallet can confirm), **see photos for proof! no paid reviews here, i wish though, jk!** and I’d 100% go back. I love a good clinic that treats you like a real person with actual insecurities, not just a walking credit card swipe — and honestly, that alone is worth the hype.

PRICE: 
I paid Php 5,000 for HIFU (did total of 500 shots) and Php 5,000 for Jawtox (60 units only) 

**Clinic Details:**
*SkinKosi Medical Aesthetic*

*Dra. Erin Keisha Manlutac*

*Address: SkinKosi Medical Aesthetic, Unit 3, 2nd floor, Altra Center, 1663 Jorge Bacobo Street, Malate*

*Phone: (0947) 749 9336*

And yes, I really took my time writing this whole thing, not just because I want to share, but because I’m lowkey manifesting that they stay open long enough for all my future glow-ups until I become a mom to xavierian kid who plays soccer every weeekend 😂 It’s not every day you find a clinic that doesn't play about your face and *doesn't* leave you mentally drafting a full-blown rant the second you step out the door. Also — and this part is me being dramatic but also dead serious — during our convo, Dra Manlutac casually mentioned they don’t really have that many clients yet and would only get pitches from influencers asking for free services instead of actual clients in their dms. And TBH, it gave me anxiety. I just found a clinic that actually gets it, and now I’m out here worrying they might close before my next touch-up. 

PS: If you've read until this part I love you already

1jlpp1m,"When skincare doesn’t have to be expensive to be effective. ✨ I just woke up like this, all thanks to consistently using these products! 🥺

I have sensitive type of skin and it was a hit or miss for me when using skincare products. Ni-risk ko nalang talaga gumamit ulit ng bagong products because of my wedding day. And thankfully, nahiyang ako kay luxe organix. Luxe organix supremacy! 🥹 

My skin would normally react agad sa products, some sunscreens, serums nag papantal ako agad. Kaya I’m so happy I found these products na hiyang sa face ko. Tapos hindi pa kamahalan. 😅

I do the sandwich method and once a week lang ako nag aapply ng retinol at tuwing gabi lang before bedtime. 

Review:

✨ Retinol + Bakuchiol - 0.1% lang kaya beginner friendly sya. No purging phase ako dito unlike sa inkeylist retinol na nagamit ko way back 2022. I think Bakuchiol really helped to make my skin look glowing & blooming. Wala akong blush dyan sa photo ha. 





✨ Ultra light glow moisturizer - It has a thick consistency but suprisingly hindi ako nalalagkitan once set na skin. It’s also lightweight! This one helps para di mag dry ang skin ko while using retinol at helps also to even out my skintone. 





✨ Miracle repair serum -  it has 4% niacinamide na safe percentage lang para no irritation. May scent sya na mabango na hindi ko type pero buti hiyang ako. No sting feeling din sya when you applied. I think eto yung naka help para mag lighten lalo mga darkspots ko. 

Using these products for a month palang pero kita na agad ang glow! 🥰

My night routine:

Facial wash

Toner

Serum

Moisturizer

Retinol

Moisturizer


Sa morning naman, toner + serum + sunscreen lang. 🥰

- 4/10. sakit sa bulsa tapos hindi naman worth it🥲 nag try ako having this only on one side of my face tapos yung other side no primer. wala ako nakitang difference??  kakahinayang kasi i was expecting so much from this. pero siguro i'll try the other primer variant nila na blurmatte, baka mas maganda??? 🥹

Bayfree eyebrow gel (shade: ash brown) P134
- 9/10. si madam anne clutz nagbudol sakin dito!!! may hair-like fibers kaya it can mimic your eyebrow hair and mas pinapa mukang fuller. as a manipis na kilay gurly, approve to! kapit na kapit din yung lapat ng eyebrows when using this

1kffsas,"Chemist's Review: Rosmar Skin Essentials Kagaya Premium Tinted Sunscreen SPF 70 PA++++ Timeout muna sa review ng mga serum lotions dahil isang panibagong sunscreen na naman ang irereview ko ngayong araw. Ito ang Kagayaku Premium Tinted Sunscreen SPF 70 PA++++. Ang tagal kong hinintay nitong sunscreen na ito bago mai-deliver: inorder ko ng week ng April 21, dumating ng May 3. Uuriratin ko itong sunscreen na ito at titingnan kung worth it bang bilhin o waste of money lang. 

TLDR:

Hindi dapat tawaging premium ang sunscreen na ito. Tadtad ng errors ang ingredient list. Halatang di dumaan sa review bago i-mass print ang box at tube. Aside sa errors, magkaiba ang IL na nasa tube at nung nasa box. Plus, sobrang sakit sa mata basahin nung text na nasa back panel ng box, dahil sa white font na ginamit. And walang SPF test report. Sayang lang pera nyo sa product na ito. 

Nabili ko itong sunscreen na ito sa halagang 295 pesos sa Tiktok. Out of the box, ang itsura ng tube nito ay reminiscent sa tube packaging ng SKIN1004 na sunscreen. From the tube, pump, pati na din sa cap nung pump. Pero walang silbi yung pump nito, hindi nadidispense yung laman kahit na makailang ulit na akong nagpump. So, no choice na ako kundi alisin ang pump cap at i-squeeze yung tube para lumabas yung laman. Apparently, masyadong viscous yung laman para lumabas sa pump. Halatang may mis-match sa characteristics nung content sa packaging na pinili. 

The bulk product itself, sabi ko nga e viscous, pero nagbebreak ang emulsion upon skin contact. Yung binili ko e kulay brown, and ang appearance ng product is parang chocolate mousse. Yung amoy nito ay may chocolate gourmand notes, as well as konting floral notes. Lightweight ang product, madaling mag-spread sa balat, may light to medium coverage, walang whitecast, at kapag nag set na sa balat e wala akong nafi-feel. 

Tumungo naman tayo sa ingredient list ng product na ito. Pinasakit ng IL ng product na ito ang mga mata ko. First, dahil ang hirap basahin ng text sa likod ng box dahil sa white font on top ng light beige background. Kinailangan ko pang i-edit yung contract settings nung pic para lang mabasa yung IL ng box. Second, dahil magkaiba ang IL na nasa box at nung nasa tube.

Ingredient list ng nasa tube:

Water, Disodium EDTA, Triethanolamine, C20-22 Alkyl Phosphate (and) C20-22 Alcohols, PEG-100 Stearate (and) Glyceryl Stearate, Polysorbate 60, Octocrylene, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Bis-Ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Diisopropyl Adipate (and) Diisopropyl Sebacate (and) Propylene, C15-19 Alkane, Dimethicone, Titanium Dioxide (and) Alumina (and) Methicone, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate, CI 77491, Phenoxyethanol, Fragrance

Eto naman ang IL na nasa box:

Water, Disodium EDTA, Triethanolamine, C20-2 Alkyl Phosphate (and) C20-22 Alcohols, PEG-100 Stearate (and) Glyceryl Stearate, Polusorbate 60, Octocrylene, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Ethylhexyl Salicylate, Bis-ethylhexyloxyphenol Methoxyphenyl Triazine, Diisopropyl Adipate (and) Diisopropyl Sebacate (and) Propylene, C15-19 Alkane, Dimethicone, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate (and) Zinc Oxide (and) Polyhydroxystearic Acid (and) Triethoxycaprylylsilane, Titanium Dioxide (and) Alumina (and) Methicone, Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate, Copolymer (and) Isohexadecane (and) Polysorbate 60 Iron Oxides (C.I. 77491) (and) Diisopropyl Dimer Dilinoleate (and) Polyglyceryl-4 Isostearate (and) Cetyl PEG/PPG-10/1 Dimethicone (and) Hexyl Laurate (and) Perfluorohexylethyl Triethoxysilane, Titanium Dioxide (and) Diisopropyl Dimer Dilinoleate (and) Polyglyceryl-4 Isostearate (and) Cetyl PEG/PPG-10/1 Dimethicone (and) Hexyl Laurate (and) Perfluorohexylethyl Triethoxysilane, Phenoxyethanol (and) Chlorphenesin (and) Aqua (and) Glycerin, Water, Gosypium Herbaceum (Cotton) Seed Extract (and) Punica Granatum Seed Extract (and) Glycerin (and) Trehalose (and) Pentylene Glycol (and) Fructoligosaccharides (and) Water (Aqua) (and) Phytic Acid, Parfum (Fragrance) 

Whoo! Inang yan, ang sakit basahin at ilista nung IL. Sa dami ng mali sa IL nito, hindi ko alam kung ano uunahin ko. Pero dahil nasimulan ko na, sasagarin ko na:

1. Dahil karamihan ng mga ingredients na ginamit dito ay complex mixtures (mapapansin nyo yung mga ingredient na tadtad ng (and) sa pagitan), either tinamad yung gumawa ng IL or just plain incompetent. Ang siste kasi kapag gumamit ng mixtures as ingredients sa isang formulation, kailangang alamin ang % composition nung mixture, then imutiply yung % ng every component ng mixture sa % nung ingredient mixture na ginamit sa formulation. Either tinamad na alamin at i-compute yung exact % nung mga components nung ingredient mixtures or hindi ito alam kung pano gawin nung gumawa ng IL. 

2. Hindi ko din alam kung anong trip nung gumawa ng IL at bakit inilagay as 2nd ingredient ang Disodium EDTA (chelating agent) at 3rd ingredient ang Triethanolamine (pH adjuster / neutralizing agent). Ang typical usage rate ng Disodium EDTA is usually below 1% (0.05% - 0.1%), samantalang ang Triethanolamine ay may maximum allowed use na 2.5% according sa Annex III ng ASEAN Cosmetic Directive. 

3. Sa tube IL, walang Zinc Oxide. Pero pagdating sa box IL, meron na. So, ano ba talaga, meron o walang Zinc Oxide sa sunscreen na ito? 

4. Since tinted sunscreen ito, expected ang presence ng Titanium dioxide, Iron Oxide Red (C.I. 77491), Iron Oxide Yellow (C.I. 77492), at Iron Oxide Black (C.I. 77499). Pero bakit sa IL ng tube at box, wala ang Iron Oxide Yellow at Iron Oxide Black? Yung totoo? 

5. Sa IL ng tube, Phenoxyethanol lang ang preservative. Pero pagdating sa IL ng box, may Chlorphenesin na.

6. Sa IL ng box: Polusorbate 60. Polysorbate 60 dapat yan. Pero weirdly, tama naman nung naulit sa Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate, Copolymer (and) Isohexadecane (and) Polysorbate 60 (pero wala dapat comma after Taurate:   Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer ang tama) 

7. Sa IL ng box: entry should be Fructooligosaccharides, hindi Fructoligosaccharides. 

8. Sa IL ng box: Diisopropyl Adipate (and) Diisopropyl Sebacate (and) Propylene.  Propylene ano? Wala kaming time hulaan kung ano yan. 

Ito na ata ang pinakamaraming mali na nakita ko sa IL ng isang product na na-launch sa Market. Sa dami ng pera (daw) ng brand owner nito, di man lang naisip mag-hire ng regulatory consultant man lang para ma-check yung IL ng product nya. 

Ngayon, punta naman tayo sa product claims. 

* SPF 70 PA++++ UVA/UVB Protection

* Tone Adapt Technology

* Lightweight

* Anti Aging

* Whitening

Sa SPF claims, wala pa akong makita na SPF test result nito from the brand owner, kaya di ko muna paniniwalaan itong claim nila na ito. 

Sa claim na Tone Adapt Technology, kalokohan yan. Marketing term lang yang tone adapt technology na yan. 

In terms of being lightweight, yes lightweight naman ito nung sinubukan ko. For anti aging, pwede naman, since sunscreens helps with aging, specifically sa photoaging. But since wala pa akong makita na SPF test report ng product na ito, di muna ako agree sa claim na ito. In terms naman ng whitening, wala akong makita sa IL na skin whitening actives sa product na ito. 

Final words:

Di ko alam kung saan kumuha ng tigas ng mukha yung brand owner na tawaging ""Premium"" itong sunscreen na ito. Ni hindi nga nagawa ang bare minimum na i-check ang mga nakasulat na text sa packaging bago magproceed sa mass printing. Sa dami ng pera (daw) ng brand owner, mano man lang na nag-hire ng consultant para i-check yan. Tapos wala pang SPF test report. Sana nagpa-conduct sila ng 3rd party in-vivo SPF test, meron naman nag ooffer nyan dito sa Pilipinas. Afford naman nung brand owner, mayaman naman (daw) sya e. E di sana solid yung claim nyang SPF 70 PA ++++.

Hindi ko alam kung seryoso ba talaga yung brand sa paglaunch nitong product na ito o nagpapapansin lang, kasi sa buong pagwowork ko sa cosmetics industry, ngayon lang ako naka-encounter ng ganitong klase ng product na hindi ko mawari kung pinag isipan ba o napagtripan lang. 

Sorry, pero first time ko sasabihin to sa pagrereview ko: Wag kayo magpabudol sa product na to. Masasayang lang pera nyo, marami pang ibang sunscreen jan na mas maganda. 

Ayun lang. Maraming salamat sa pagbabasa. At laging maging mapanuri sa mga binibili at balak nating gamitin na products. ",https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kffsas,1040,117,Review,belo,local,brow,tiktok,2025-05-05,Neutral
1i3u1ax,"Finally got my 🐱 successfully waxed for the first time! I have always wanted to get brazilian wax for the longest time na but have always been very conscious and shy, since hindi pantay yung color ko down there especially sa inner thighs, I have very noticeable discoloration and hyperpigmentation since I’m on the bigger side. So I was always scared of both being judged and the pain, so I never did it, kahit laging nag-ooffer yung mga previous wax techs ko. But I finally had the courage to do it today, and I must say what a good experience it was!

For context, I do underarm waxing and upperlip threading regularly kaya somehow may experience na ako with hair removal. I usually get mine done sa Laybare, but just recently switched to Brow Lounge after hearing good reviews from my friends and I must say na I like their service much better. Mas pulido sila sa threading and waxing, and they actually take their time during the process, hindi minamadali ng mga technicians, unlike ng mga previous experience ko with LB and my first UA wax was with Hey Sugar before and hindi ko siya nagustuhan, so hindi ko na siya naconsider + pricier din sila. 

So for my first brazilian experience I was considering Brow Lounge since they use hot wax and mas less painful daw siya especially if first time. But then after researching and reading through in here, I ultimately went with Barenaked in SM North Edsa and I’m glad I did, so just wanted to share my experience here :)

1. They asked me if may appointment ako beforehand, but I wasn’t aware na need pala since wala naman silang app unlike sa LB and wala rin on their website. They told me na you just have to send a text sa branch number nila, but they accept walk-ins din naman, and nung nagpunta ako kahit may mga waiting, I was accommodated right away after filling up on their tablet. 
2. The layout of their salon is pretty good also, nice and very relaxing yung ambiance. Not too dark or bright. 
3. Their brazilian wax is P600 only, which I think is pretty decent na compared to other waxing salons na mas mataas ang price, given the quality of BN’s service. You pay right away rin after filling up. 
4. They have their own restroom sa loob ng salon which was clean and a plus for me, may provided na bidet, feminine wash, and tissue. So I freshened up muna before going inside the cubicle, and made sure na patted dry lalo na sa back part. Wala naman din akong any preparation, I didn’t drink pain reliever cause I wanted to know and see if I’d be able to handle and withstand the pain. My wax tech also doesn’t recommend it, but a personal preference na lang siguro. But I did make sure to wear a loose fitting and comfy pants and brought an extra and clean pair of underwear with me to change into after. 
5. The cubicle itself is not that big, sakto lang pero hindi naman masikip, with a huge mirror on the wall. May hooks and hanger for your clothes, and small fan din inside para hindi siguro mainitan and masyadong magpawis yung both client and tech. Their whole salon looked clean and sanitary also, including the restroom and the cubicles. 
6. Super nakakahiya at first, lalo na nung ininstruct ako ni ate to remove all my pambaba HAHAH. I had to ask her including the panties, which she laughed at and said yes. I felt vulnerable and exposed while laying on the bed naked waist down 🤣 but you gotta do what you gotta do. 
7. I was so grateful din to have had a very nice and kind wax technician, super bait ni ate and she was very encouraging. But also lahat din ng staff nila were very kind thankfully. They greeted me with all smiles. I told my wax tech na it was my first time, and I was very conscious but she reassured me na it’s normal and they’ve seen a thousand 🐱 so it doesn’t really faze them anymore. She even complimented my kiffy lol. As a first timer, ofc I still felt shy and awkward lalo na habang inaassess ni ate yung situation ko down there, but she was very technical and professional about it. I also don’t shave, trim lang, which she said na mas okay nga raw since it makes it easier for them to wax it and mas magiging less painful for the client. But I really appreciated how she was just talking and making chika to me the whole time and made sure na I was comfortable and relaxed during the process. 
8. Barenaked uses sugaring and sabi ni ate na mas hindi raw siya painful since they remove the hair portion by portion. Unlike sa strip wax na maraming hair agad yung nasasama in one go. The pain level for me was honestly just a 5/10. I was expecting it to be more painful, but it definitely was tolerable. May pain pa rin naman and uncomfy siya since you’ll really feel the hair being ripped out, but it was not THAT bad. Although I have to say na mas masakit lang when they get near the slit part, because you can really feel na the skin there is much thinner so mas sensitive pag tinatanggal na yung hair. But honestly, I still find upperlip threading waaay more painful than brazilian wax. I was even just using my phone and watching Tiktoks at one point. Although expect lang na it will be kind of sore and uncomfortable after since mas sensitive yung skin mo down there. They also applied a soothing cream all over the area right after and gave me “aftercare” instructions. 
9. I wasn’t able to time it, pero more or less 30 minutes lang yung entire procedure. Maybe I have a high pain tolerance rin so I didn’t ask ate to pause in between, tuloy tuloy lang siya nag wax. The only time we had a “rest” was nung nagpalit and kumuha siya ng new sugar wax, but it only took her less than 5 minutes. 
10. My only con siguro is their bed. Super wobbly and shaky 😆 lalo na nung sa part na yung butt area ko na yung winawax and I would have to turn sideways, parang anytime masisira or magigiba siya. 

Overall it was such a great and fun experience for me. Definitely a 10/10 and super worth your money for me. I’m sure na Barenaked will be my go-to for brazilian, but I still might actually try Brow Lounge just to see if may difference ba. They recommend doing it monthly as sort of a maintenance, but still up to you. If you’re planning on getting one but is also conscious and hesitant, honestly just go for it. Hindi mo na rin actually siya mapapansin during kasi the wax techs will be all about removing the hair. It also really helps a lot to get one from waxing salons with good reviews and feedbacks so you’ll end up having a good waxing experience.

1krtzre,"Propaganda I am not falling for fashion & beauty brands edition (with reasons) Since trending to sa tiktok, I want to make my own thread like this, 



1. Issy products - ang galing nila sa marketing kaya nabudol ako before ng set nila (skintint, concealer and powder worth 1k+), good for oily skin daw. Wala pang isang oras sobrang oily na ng mukha ko, at halos walang tint ang skintint nila same with concealer. Not good for person with dark spots/acne marks and especially with oily skin. Kaya kahit gano kaganda pa marketing nila di na ko nagpapabudol. 

2. Mera - never again! I had review of their tops here sa sub, napaka cheap ng quality at inconsistent pa ang sizing. Sumikat lang, nag mahal na yung pricing pero instead na MAS gumanda ang quality, kabaliktaran ang nangyari! 


3. Bsco - ang cheap din ng quality ng damit nila tas ang mamahal pa, not to mention na naka dalawa or tatlong rebrand sila ng brand nila.


4. Hiraya - wouldn’t recommend, hindi nag last ng 1 month yung dikit sakin. Sayang pera.


5. Rejuv sets - any brands basta rejuv sets, pass. 


6. Gmeelan - underarm whitening na hindi naman nakaka whiten



Eto lang naalala ko, will probably edit once may naalala pa ko. How about yours?

1eydf3e,"Makeup i actually bring with me to travel!! skin type: dry with flakiness on the sides of my nose & mouth. 
skin shade: light - light medium with neutral undertones leaning cool.  

I just travelled recently and also attended a concert during my trip (tds3 in mnl) and these were the makeup products that without fail made my look of the day always on point!! Most of the products I’ve had for years and am still using to this day (peep old packaging of issy & grwm) and most of these have reached HG status while only some i’ve been thinking of replacing ><. 

HG STATUS:  
Nars pot concealer - the hype is so real, i have dry skin so skin prep is a must for me and when i tell u this has never creased on me nor did it budge throughout the day 🙂‍↕️ I just found that applying it in thin layers and blending with a finger or puff better than using a brush cuz the latter makes it look kinda patchy/streaky.  

Detail fresh filter foundation - so light weight and skin like but very buildable coverage my makeup lasted from 10am - 11pm during concert day and it did not hulas one bit 🤩. 
  
Tower28 concealer - this concealer is so creamy and not drying i use this everyday and it has never failed me once!! I found that the key to not make ur under eyes crease is to apply concealer below ur under eyes and blend upwards this way the product won’t settle into the lines ^^. 
  
Grwm contour stick - i’ve heard a lot of bad reviews about this cuz ppl say it’s messy and melts a lot but i haven’t encountered that problem yet. Instead, i found this cream contour to be so creamy and blendable and the shade range doesn’t look muddy and even if u put too much they can be sheered out a lot when u blend. 

Flowerknows eyelash curler - i used to blame my stubborn lashes never staying up on the mascara i used but when i discovered this only then did i found out how big mascara curlers play a part on curling your lashes. This changed my life fr!  
  
Etude curl fix mascara - really lengthens ur lashes and keeps the curl, doesn’t budge, and is really waterproof that it’s kinda hard to remove 😅 it slips off easier with a cleansing balm but if ur using a cleansing oil medj mas mahirap alisin hahaha. 

Issy true flex powder - i usually avoid powders cuz i have dry skin but this one never cakes no matter how much i apply and is the perfect powder for touch ups. 
  
Heroine eyebrow mascara - the perfect light brow kpop look that lasts all day!! I’m not really a fan of laminated brows and this mascara just gives the perfect hold to keep my brows in place while also giving it the tint i want. 
  
Sunnies face peptide lip treatment - idc if this is a dupe for the rhode lip peptide or not this in itself is such a good product!! My lip lines are blurred, they’re moisturized, and best of all it’s so glossy. I love this so much and it’s really affordable compared to its intl competitors. 
  
Kate lip monster lipsticks - my most long lasting lipsticks that don’t dry out your lips and even leaves a stain after the gloss wears off!! The color pay off is also so accurate with what you see on the actual product itself even with the hyperpigmentation on my lips!!  
  
Flower knows blush - so blurring and isn’t powdery or heavy on the face! i really use this more as a setting powder for my cream blush since the color pay off isn’t too pigmented kaya di niya maooverthrow yung original color nung cream blush ko but at the same time still provides a little pigment. 
  
For the other products i like them a lot but they’re not products that i would immediately repurchase if i run out and i might even look for other alternatives since they haven’t really reached holy grail status for me. Would i repurchase them? Yes, but would i also consider other items in the market? Yes. However, if u want an in depth review of any of them just ask me below and i’ll let u know!! Also, u might notice i don’t have a setting spray in the pic that’s cause i forgot mine (y.o.u. setting spray) so i borrowed my tita’s (ct) and also for setting powder she just gifted me a mini laura mercier translucent powder cuz i finished my bys one so its also not in the pic ><. 
  
Hopefully, you found some product recos that resonates with u if u have a similar skin type with me and that this posts helped u!! I’ll also make a separate post for skin prep/skin care i used to battle my dryness hihihi that’s all from me, bye -`♡´-",https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1eydf3e,931,127,Review,"sunnies, belo, issy, rhode, grwm, nars, laura mercier, kate","local, local, local, local, local, international, international, international","foundation, concealer, powder, powders, blush, contour, setting spray, mascara, eyebrow, brow, lashes, lash, lipstick, lipsticks, brush, eyelash curler, makeup",,2024-08-22,Neutral

One of the most badly hit (apart from my books) were my makeup collection. I am sad, but I keep telling myself these are just stuff and I can still replace them.

1mkxm23,"PERFUME COLLECTION ✨ 2023 pa ako nagsimulang mag-collect ng perfumes. Marami na rin ako na-let go sa collection. Miss Dior Blooming Bouquet, Versace Dylan Blue, Armani My Way, Chanel Chance Eau Tendre, Jo Malone English Pear & Freesia, LV Apogée, at Bvlgari Amethyst. I sold them to friends kasi hindi ko na masyadong nagagamit and honestly, medyo same same na sila ng vibe for me.

Let’s talk about my current rotation.

⸻

Most Used Perfume in PH

1. LV Le Jour Se Lève
Perfect everyday scent dito sa Pinas. Wala masyadong kaamoy, very expensive clean girl ang dating. Fresh, light, pero sophisticated. Definitely will repurchase pag naubos.

2. Glossier You
Sobrang dreamy ng dry down. Ideal if you have kids, light lang as long as you don’t overspray. Compliment-magnet, and super long-lasting. For me, dupe siya ng Le Labo Gaiac 10 (Japan exclusive), halos same notes.

3. Armani Si Passione
My favorite vanilla perfume, light, pang daily, and beginner-friendly. Gift from my bf kasi naamoy niya sa isang flight attendant at tinanong pa kung anong scent. The kind of vanilla na hindi nakaka-suffocate. 10/10.

⸻

Celebrity-Inspired Purchases

1. Diptyque Eau des Sens (Jessy Mendiola)
Malaki influence ni Jessy sakin sa Perfume, after her vlog, bumili ako agad. Best blind buy ever. Clean girl meets baby girl scent. Light lang pero leaves a soft trace in the room. Downside: kailangan mag-respray kasi mabilis mag-fade like 3hrs.

2. PDM Valaya (Bianca De Vera)
Not the exclusif, pero halos same lang, this one’s just a bit sweeter. Very musky vanilla, beast mode longevity. Two sprays will last you ’til the next day. 7.5/10, good for cold weather.

⸻

Korean Perfume Picks

1. Tamburins Chamo & Evening Glow
My holy grail for that subtle luxury vibe. Chamo is unique and amoy expensive, while Evening Glow is a soft floral perfect for daily wear. Both are 10/10 for me. Mas prefer ko to kaysa Granhand na brand, mas light at refined.

2. Kinfolk Notes OOT
Jasmine notes and light lang, more wearable dupe of Gucci Flora. 8/10! hindi overpowering, perfect for casual days.

⸻

Jo Malone Collection
1. Nectarine Blossom & Honey – 60% used up, but I paused wearing it kasi dumami na kaamoy haha. Still, one of the best Jo Malone scents.
2. Peony & Blush Suede – Light floral-fruity, long-lasting if not oversprayed. 8/10.
3. English Pear & Sweet Pea – Replaced my English Pear & Freesia (which became too common). Sweet Pea smells softer and more modern. 9/10.

———

Long-Lasting & Compliment-Getters

1. MFK Baccarat Rouge 540
Still unmatched. Original hits differently. Smells more divine when mixed with skin heat. Luxury in a bottle. Worth every peso. Closest dupe I’ve smelled is ZARA Red Temptation :)

2. Prada Paradoxe
Hated it at first, too strong for a beginner. But after smelling it on someone in a crowd (concert), nagets ko na hype. Nangingibabaw scent kahit mainit. Perfect strong perfume sa Pinas. Sobrang bango.

3. YSL Libre
Another one I initially disliked for being too strong. Same sa prada ayoko dito noong una, nakakahilo sya for me. Pero nagbabago yung taste ng collectors kapag tumagal tagal. 2023 ko pa to tntry bilhin pero everytime na ttry ko sample, not for me talaga kasi super strong nya. Then eventually this 2025, na appreciate ko na sya. Di na ko makatulog kaya binili ko na. It’s strong and mas okay sya gamitin kapag gabi :) got a lot of compliments as well. Hanggang 2 sprays lang ako dito at umaabot na sya 24hrs.

⸻

Le Labo Favorites

1. Rose 31 – My only rose perfume. Distinct, classy, and memorable. 10/10.
2. Another 13 – Unisex, intimate, deceptive longevity, you’ll forget you’re wearing it after 3 hours. Makakalimutan mo na nag perfume ka, pero yung mga nakakasama mo hindi.
3. Santal 33 – Gift from my bf, so it stays in my collection forever. Only for date nights, medjo nakakahilo kapag mainit.

⸻

Other perfumes
1. Kilian Love, Don’t Be Shy – pagka amoy ko nito binili ko na agad. Super bango. It’s Rihanna’s perfume. Ginaya to ng PDM, same sila ng Oriana. Long lasting and bagay sa cold wearher!
2. Chloé PDM & Lancôme Idôle – Both are 10/10 but packaging spray can be frustrating. Kaya minsan ko nalang magamit. Will repurchase!
3. Sol de Janeiro – My post-shower “pang-bahay” scent. Yes, I still wear perfume for workouts and bedtime.
4. Chanel Coco Mademoiselle – A timeless classic. 7/10.

1ii941b,"SHARING MY FIRST BRAZILIAN EXPERIENCE AT HEY SUGAR! I finally decided to get my pussy waxed at Hey Sugar. After reading several stories here about pussy waxing, nagkaroon na ako ng lakas ng loob kanina (Feb 5, 2025).

  
I was really conscious and shy since I have hyperpigmentation kahit na maputi akong babae. I'm bothered na baka i-judge ako or pag-usapan after the session.  Pero napagod na ako kaka-trim, and I really want the clean, smooth, and hair-free pussy from waxing as others say. (Wala pa budget for laser lol)

I chose Hey Sugar SM City Santa Rosa. Base sa reviews dito sa r/beautytalkph, they use natural sugar and it's really recommended. But take note, SM City Santa Rosa has other waxing salons too, such as Barenaked, Lay Bare, Brow Lounge, Ayumi, and Happy Brows.

After the receptionist greeted me, she asked what service I would avail. I immediately said Brazilian and added that it was my first time (hoping it would lessen my nervousness and awkwardness). She assured me and said that there are a lot of first-timers who are also nervous and shy initially. I asked what was recommended for my first time, and she recommended the Hot wax (Php 950) as it is tolerable and less painful. She then gave me a Service Consent Form containing a Pre-Service Questionnaire and Post-Service Care Tips that also serve as an authorization.

After signing the form, the aesthetician asked if I wanted to go to the CR prolly to prepare and ensure I was clean down there. Walang CR inside HS's salon so I used SM's public CR almost adjacent to the salon. I ensure I'm dry down there before returning. I also wore a loose cotton panty and a loose skort to prevent friction and irritation and for my pussy to breathe.

Here's what happened:

1. The aesthetician escorted me inside the cubicle. The cubicle was not big nor small. Curtain yung nagsisilbing pinto. She kindly instructed me to remove my skort and panty. And that I should lie down with my butt area na nakalapat sa disposable na panlatag. After that lumabas na muna sya. Walang mirror sa cubicle, wala ring mounted hook na pwedeng pagsabitan ng jacket at bag. I just put my bag sa mini table na pinaglalagyan ng artificial plant. After ko maghubad lahat ng pambaba, humiga na ako with a mini pillow in my head at tinakpan ko muna ng towel yung lower body ko.

2. The aesthetician entered the cubicle, turned on the lamp, and positioned it katapat ng private area ko. I initiated a conversation with her, saying nahihiya ako but then she assured me na okay lang yun. Nagstart sya sa pubic hair ko just below my puson. Pagpahid nya ng hot sugar wax, she asked me if okay lang ba yung init. The wax was not painfully hot, warm lang sya halos.

3. I asked Ate if my pubic hairs' length is suitable na for waxing (mas mahaba ng kaunti sa grain of rice), she said na medyo maikli raw (hindi pantay trimming ko, may napaikli raw). Mukhang maiiwan daw yon. So I asked her if it's okay lang na pumunta untrimmed, she answered na it's better kasi they can trim naman.

4. After mga tatlong pahid ng sugar sa magkakatabing area, the pulling starts, the aesthetician used waxing paper strips. So sunod sunod na hila sa mga part na may sugar wax. The pain was 7/10 sa part na yon. Kapag sunod sunod yung hila masakit at mahapdi. Kahit napapagalaw ako minsan, the bed was not wobbly at all, it was steady.

5.  I asked Ate if I can breathe and rest kasi mahapdi, she said pwedeng pwede naman. Kasi talagang ambilis ni ate magpahid at maghila. Talagang sunod sunod. She went out saglit then pumasok na.  Sa labia majora part na sya nagpapahid ng sugar wax and I asked if normal ba na may sumisigaw sa sakit haha, she said na may mga customer daw na ganun lalo pag mababa pain tolerance, so she assured me I can scream if I want. I asked her too if totoo ba na after several sessions ng waxing eh di na ganun kakapal ang tubo ng pubic hair at di na ganun kasakit, and she said yes, lalo na raw if the waxing is done monthly. Still it's 7/10 pain sa labia majora part.

6. Sa parts na natatakpan ng labia minora, mas masakit since ang nipis ng balat doon. Pinagpawisan na rin ako non sa mukha, lower and upper back as a pawisin girly. Haha.

  
7. Sa perineum area (upper and side to side) 5/10 na lang yung pain at less hapdi. After nun pinahiga ako ni Ate facing sideways since sa area around anus na sya magpapahid. 4/10 na lang yung pain level don,

8. Since may natira pa talagang hairs sa pussy ko, need daw i-thread ni Ate. It was 7/10 pain level din lalo kapag sunod sunod, mahapdi rin sya.

9. The session lasted less than 20 minutes. Talagang mabilis lang. Ate ended the session by spraying a liquid sa pubic area ko. (She didn't mention what it is). She then reminded me of basic after care tips such as pwede lang basain after 8 hours.

  
10. After session, tsaka ako nagbayad sa receptionist (Php950). I handed my aesthetician a php100 tip. The receptionist asked me how was my first experience. I thanked them too.

Sa tantya ko 12:20 PM nag-start yung waxing at 12:40 PM natapos. As of now (8 PM) di na sya mahapdi although yung mga pores (if that's the term) na napagbunutan ng hair eh medyo namumula pa rin. Ganito rin ba experience nyo? Also now ko lang napansin na may naiwan pa ring sobrang liit na hair, siguro less than 5 lang in different areas, I assume di na masyadong nakita ng aesthetician kasi sobrang liit na. Also, they have sugar scrub for sale Php480 na may whitening and can target and prevent chicken skin daw.

  
Overall satisfied naman ako. 8/10 for the experience. But I'm also willing to try other waxing salons too. I had price comparisons of my mentioned salons but nasiraan ako ng cellphone so I can't put it here.

1cwyeda,"what i use for work my go-to makeup for work

reviewing my makeup products for work as a corpo girly. i sometimes commute too, so these products were tested under the manila heat! 

Products used: (Local x Int’l)

*BASE*
1. Skin Aqua UV Sunscreen - my 2nd tub! switched from belo dewy + tinted bc they caused milia buildup on my jaw 😔
2. Colourette’s First Base (Talisay) - been using this for 3 weeks now! Truly the most lightweight skin tint I’ve tried. (Better than Issy [Honey] and Maybelline [06] — mabigat sila sa katagalan). This one really settles into your skin. Though I find that Issy has more coverage (or i just dont put enough)
3. Saem Concealer (2.25) - 3rd tub! My go-to concealer. I just buy on the 🍊 app. So cheap but the coverage is insane. Lasts the whole day too basta set w powder!


*BLUSH*
1. Grwm Milktint (Honeydew) - old forma. i keep going back to this. It’s better than blk bc when you diffuse it, the pigment stays on unlike the latter. Lasts pretty long too even on its own. Tagal din maubos lol last year pa ito. 
2. Ever Bilena Pillow pop (Dreamy Coral) - this is kinda mid but i just like the shade for my morena skin. It lasts long too
3. Colorpop Born to Blush Palette - the og powder blush. Just wish i had this in a diff shade it feels too peachy on my skin


*LIPS*
1. BLK CAOP (Reef)- I like this better on the lips. 
2. Happy Skin Lip Mallow (Drip) - still the best local lip tint. So lightweight and lasts so long!! Just top it off w another lippie if you dont like reapplying. Not the best shade for my skin kaya inuubos ko lang
3. Maybelline Vinyl Ink (Punchy) - love the gloss! It lasts long too. Not drying naman for me
4. Rom&nd Juicy Tint (Dark Coconut) - not as long lasting as Maybelline, but I like the shade. I use this to retouch at the office
5. Vaseline Petroleum Jelly - the only lip moisturizer i need tbh. Dont use lip balm na, this is enough! I only apply at night
6. Ever Bilena Lip Serum (Latte) - I just use this as a topper. Mlbb shade siya and it’s rlly moisturizing too!


*SETTING SPRAY & POWDER*
1. Nyx Dewy Matte - Keeps my makeup in place! Also like how dewy it feels. 
2. Innisfree No Sebum Mineral - thank you to this subreddit for the budol! Can confirm, it really mattifies my skin. 

*EYES & BROWS*
1. Strokes Microblade Pen (Bauxite) - the best pen out there! Lasts the whole dayy even without the gel. 2nd tub!
2. Strokes Clear Brow Gel - LOVE THIS. Trust when I say your brows wont budge! Used this when running out & my brows did not budge. Kinda hard to work with lang since it’s kinda stiff. But i still love it since it lasts the whole day. 
3. Barenbliss Magic Eyeliner (Ocular Brown) - 2nd tub! The tip’s beginner-friendly and this lasts the wholee day. Used this amid the UP campus heat in college and it survived. Still use it now when working
4. Barenbliss Mascara (not in pic) - I dont always wear mascara, but I’ve had this for so long. Keeps my lashes curled pretty decently throughout the day naman. 

That’s it. I hope this helps. 🩷 ",https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1cwyeda,863,114,Review,"ever bilena, blk, colourette, belo, happy skin, issy, grwm, maybelline, into you","local, local, local, local, local, local, local, international, international","concealer, powder, blush, setting spray, eyeliner, mascara, brow gel, brow, lashes, lash, palette, lip balm, skin tint, moisturizer, makeup",,2024-05-21,Neutral

I am 31/F with Oily-Combination and Sensitive skin type.

The upper photo was taken last March 2024. At that time, my skincare routine was:

AM
-Klued 2% Salicylic Acid Gentle Cleanser
-Ellana Stay Fresh Moisturizer
-Pond's Hyaluron Sunscreen (Love this! 10/10)

PM
-Klued 2% Salicylic Acid Gentle Cleanser
-Ellana Stay Fresh Moisturizer (Kung hindi ko makalimutan)

However, due to my noticeable textured skin, though somewhat smooth, I decided to try other products.

Here is my updated routine:

AM
-Klued Barrier Support Hydrating Jelly Cleanser
-Hada Labo Premium Lotion
-Biore UV Bright Milk

PM
-Klued 2% Salicylic Acid Gentle Cleanser
-Klued Double Oat Moisturizer

I have been using these for 2 months. So far I am satisfied with the results. Although, I think it can still be better or can improve more. 🤔

Later on, I will try to slowly integrate Retinol and Vit C into my routine. Retinol and Vit C recommendations are highly appreciated!

1b4e9js,"Kaway-kaway sa mga 30s na ngayon lang natututo maging kikay 🙋‍♀️ I’m in my 30s and I think I’m way too late on learning make-up and hair. HS I thought sheesh kikay/girly naman, I was really into bands (ahaha emo-emo ba) back then. Uso pa ang mga ponds powder noon and I think tinted balm? For my hair laging nagpapa straight! 

College, wala busy ang ateng mag-aral, di naman din nag-clubbing, school - dorm - bahay lang. But nung graduation talagang nagpa make-up ako, syempre naman kailangan naman atleast maging mas maganda (chos) bukod sa pang araw-araw na natural na kagandahan (ahahaha).  I had my hair cut short when I was in college, napapanot ako sa stress.

20s came, I was a sad newbie nurse with meager salary and tried make-up. I bought e-tude bb cream, the color definitely didn’t match my skin 😂🤣, I am fair-skinned, dyusko, aba’y parang Edward Cullen ang dating sa puti, powdery white. One of my titas bought bare mineral foundation for me and a friend of mine gave me some revlon eyeshadow. I tried to watch some youtube and got intimidated because they use a loooot of brushes (fan brush, blending brush, contour, number keme-keme brush) I’m like da hell, how dafuq I’m going to afford all this. The foundation that I got came with a brush, so I’m like well, I’ll just wing it and see how it looks. I thought I did okay, then my sister commented “and cakey mo tingnan” wala na it shattered my confidence to wear make up again. I played a little bit with the eyeshadow, but instead I looked like a raccoon. I never really cared about my hair, it’s either short or shoulder length. Hindi na kulot din, idk it kinda got better. 

After 10 years, now being able to afford stuffs, AFTER SEEING THE DYSON AIRWRAP AD, I’m like you know I think it’s time. I’ve read so many reviews here in reddit and seen so much after hair transformation. I went ahead an bought it. 90% of the time idk what the heck’in heck I’m doing, pero afterwards it’s like a really good salon hair blow out! Yung kaibigan ko worth it daw ba? I told her for a beginner, who doesn’t give a flying fuck about hair before it’s worth it. Sa make up wala pa din, I’m interested on knowing which class to take, kaso wala. And today, went to TJ-Maxx saw Glossier (I’ve been eyeing that brand (and Merit minimalist keme-keme without too many brushes needed). I got the eyeshadow trio clay and boy brow, tapos yung eyeshadow brush. I went to youtube again and followed some videos. The eyeshadow wasn’t so bad. It was really pigmented. Looking at my face again in the mirror wearing the eyeshadow and brow make up, I think I want to try to learn again. 

Last year or two years again I’ve been really confident with my style. I now wear those sleeveless even if my keloids are showing. And now I want to try something new. I am loving myself I wished I wasn’t so insecure back then.

1bnldlg,"Tiktok hype makeup products I swear by Siguro at some point lahat tayo nabudol na ng tiktok videos to buy something pero ended up commissioned pala ang posts via yellow basket. It’s always going to be a hit or miss so I’m going to share with you some of the products I really love that I saw sa tiktok.

1. O TWO O 36H Mascara - Take this with a grain of salt because the brand has been facing several backlash na because some of their products are non FDA Approved huhu. Disclaimer lang.

What I love about this product is IT HOLDS THE CURL IN MY LASHES THE WAY MAYBELLINE CAN’T DO. Tube mascara din sya so easier to take off and hindi siya nag smusmudge. I found this product out dahil nakikita ko sya lagi sa tiktok pero what sold me is ginagamit siya ng athlete kong friend sa professional games nya and kahit anong galaw ni ate INTACTED parin lashes nya. 

Price ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ / 199 sya ngayon sa shopee (Cheap comes with eyelash curler)
Hold ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
Packaging ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ (Parang Teviant)

2. Paulash Clear Glue

Cult favorite na to so hahahha

Price ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ (I wish it was cheaper :()
Hold ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
Packaging ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

3. Foccalure Soft Powder Face Blush 

Nainggit ako sa video ni “i like to see your point of viewwww” blush ons. Apparently ito daw pinaka closest sa PINK fresh kpop effect so nabudol talaga ako.

Till now gamit ko padin. Ang ganda ng pigment at lapat sa skin. Ang dami nila shades and they also have powder and cream versions ng shades nila!

Hindi natatanggal agad kahit makipag sampalan ako. Downside lang is ang konti ng product. Sobrang liit lang ng product so keri lang. 89 pesos ko lang naman nabili.

Price ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ CHEAP MHIE
Hold ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ (baka kasi sa baking ko lang toh)

1gxwuqd,"GRWM Cosmetics' new release is huuuge! 🙀 GRWM Cosmetics has relaunched their customizable palette with an improved magnetic palette pagckaging with brand new eyeshadows, eyeshadow bases, new blush, bronzer, highlighter finishes & formulas, multiuse complexion creams & color correctors, finishing & brightening powders, new brush sets, and more. 

They also have Ms Heart Evangelista as their first ever celebrity endorser and a few influencers in their campaign materials for this collection. It is also worth noting that the brand has partnered with an NGO, HMR Envirocycle, for a recycling program for the waste produced by their products' packaging.

What do we think of this new release from GRWM? Are we excited or overwhelmed? I hope they finally open a store in my city and sana magkaroon rin sila ng lipsticks in pans for their new magnetic palette system and also minis/travel sizes for their loose powder and milk tints. 🤞🏼✨

1jads6c,"too many makeup releases! hot take but i can't keep up with the new product release every other week from local brands. 

it's overconsumption/overproduction na! but we mask it with ""you can never have too many options and inclusivity for everyone since we all have diff skin types"" 

new lucky beauty palettes, absidy foundation, reformulated blk face stacks and theres even a new makeup brand called Popique na i think same owners lang  din ng Issy, Chuchu, and Lucky. tapos almost same lang din naman products nila lol. Daming sister makeup brands with same formulas lang naman but just diff marketing!

tapos give it a few months, they'll change the packaging since may defect or leaks daw. tapos mamarket na ""we listened to you guys & we made them better"" and we eat it up, thanking them for ~listening~ to us.

the truth? they rushed production and didn't do enough tests on the packaging. this is a very WASTEFUL kasi they have to make new packaging na naman.

Rant lang guys since im so tired of this cycle. Also a reminder to be more intentional with what you buy!

1iqthtw,"Have you ever encountered a rude and disrespectful saleslady? I recently commented this on a thread here and decided to post it so I could also hear your stories! 

I have encountered rude and disrespectful salesladies at Colourette Dept. Store in SM North Edsa. They were salesladies of 2 other brands. 

I was very excited to buy their ColorBounce blush and First Base. I saw a saleslady in the Silkygirl kiosk and she was doing her makeup using testers, mukhang annoyed na nagtanong ako sakanya. At first I didn’t know na saleslady  pala siya ng other brand, but I experienced other salesladies helping me out kahit hindi nila brand. 

I asked her if they were other shades, she replied with “‘Yan lang nandyan.” in an annoyed tone. I asked again if they have the mini version of the first base and said in the same tone but this time ruder and more annoyed, “‘Yan nga lang nandyan.”  I responded with a simple “Okay po”. 

So I ended up just getting the Colorbounce. I asked her for a new stock and she SIGHED LOUDLY and said “Tumabi ka nga.” and reached for the stock cabinet. While opening it, nagdadabog siya! When she couldn’t find it, she asked the saleslady of Absidy na nakikipagchikahan sa iba pang saleslady. Before the other sl opened the cabinet, she also said “Tabi nga.” No ma’am/miss mentioned nor a single “Excuse me” , they just gave me the product and I said thank you.

After that, I was till roaming around to look at other stores. I passed by the kiosk again and the Absidy saleslady was giving me looks.

Hays. Buti na lang I really wanted to purchase the product, kung hindi I wouldn’t have put up with them. Naistorbo ko pa ata ang pagmamakeup gamit ang testers at chismisan with other salesladies!

1k3cr8p,"My Fragrance Collection + review  I only started getting interested in fragrances this year. Quick info about my biases, my taste isn't too sophisticated and my fave scents are gourmands, freshies and roses. I dislike cinnamon and similar spices, heavy white florals and synthetic fruity/candy scents.  Ratings doesn't take into consideration longevity.

Lattafa Nebras - 7/10-  Vanilla with mint and berry-flavored chocolate. I haven't smelled Eilish to compare.   It's not a scent I like by itself, reminds me a bit of car freshener. I use it for layering, and WOW it layers well with different perfumes, the mintiness adds a fresh touch

Replica Lazy Sunday Morning - 5/10 - I didn't know what I was expecting!  Doesn't smell like a regular perfume.  Smells like fresh laundry, the boring unscented kind. Smells to me like opening a cabinet of old clothes. Surprised though it lasted well on my clothes since it had bad longevity ratings on fragrantica, could still smell it 5 hours later

Bianco Latte -9.5/10 Beautiful delectable scent. Smells like a pastry shop. Creamy, milky,  sweet, the most photorealistic gourmand I've tried.  People are saying the longevity of this is insane, but to me, it lasts as long as Eclaire.  BUT now that I've worn it for quite some time now, I did start noticing the rubbery notes along with Eclaire.

Lattafa Eclaire - 9.5/10 I thought they were exactly the same as Bianco Latte, but after wearing Eclaire for a while, finally noticed a difference. Eclaire smells a bit like alcohol on the initial spray but it disappears after seconds, but that's it, all my Lattafa perfumes have that alcoholic first spray actually. Amazing dupe otherwise!

Kilian Princess -7/10 Marshmallow and citrusy ginger. I don't smell any matcha. Super weak. Ginger is very strong on initial spray.

Sol De Janeiro 62 - 10/10 - A youtuber I follow wears this so I was curious, and this was one of the first things I bought exploring fragrances, and it's now my fave!! Not too sweet IMO, great gourmand for our weather. Vanilla and coconut, very creamy and fresh.  The Bumbum cream is nice too, I got the big Sephora set. Not long-lasting sadly.

Sol De Janeiro 71 - 1/10 -Jellybelly popcorn flavor. Artificial and very sweet. Unpictured, I gave this to my brother. 

Fragrance World Caramel Macchiato 1/10- my first coffee fragrance. I see this being compared to Khamrah Qahwah, but I've only smelled Khamrah and it definitely has that same spicy cinnamon DNA, but I like Khamrah better. Reminds me more of Pumpkin Spice Latte or Chai Latte, which I both hate.  The longevity is insane for me. Or maybe I'm just especially sensitive to it since I hate it. Not sure why this doesn't have ""warm spicy"" as its main accords

Christine Lhuillier Baby Powder - 8/10 - I love this but it reminds me of my dog's baby powder cologne LOL  😭 Whenever I pass by my lola and I'm wearing this she ALWAYS stops to compliment me 😂😂 Long-lasting for its cheap price. 

Noble Blush - 10/10 - Smells like a soapy, rosy baby powder. Dove pink vibes. Smells like the color pink.   Very longlasting and projects well. My mom and brother finds this headache inducing, might not repurchase it because of this 🥹

Tommy Girl - 7/10- White florals and citrus. Very clean girl scent! Gifted by my uncle. He brought home a box of perfumes for the family, I was late and was the last one to pick and got this (box looked boring for them I guess 😂), ended up everyone liked this one the most and agreed it smelled super fresh! Beautiful, but I'm not into wearing white florals

Paris Corner Lactea Divina -  7/10 -A scary blind buy, because I didn't like Paris Corner decants I got (Khair Fusion and Pistachio) I haven't smelled Blanche Bete. Lactonic, a Milky vanilla with a bit of florals to balance it out, not too sweet. I use it for layering Eclaire/Bianco Latte, but it does overpower Eclaire and BL so I use only a bit, it projects so well. Some people smell sour milk from this, and I can imagine how, it does smell like baby spitting out milk formula to me at times. Very longlasting. 

Choco musk roll-on - 8/10 - For the price of 125PHP it's pretty great! Doesn't smell warm spicy to me, purely vanilla and chocolate. Intimate projection on me. 

Delina Exclusif - 9/10 - Rose and fruits. Feminine and pretty!

Lattafa Ana Abiyedh Rouge - 4/10 - BKR540 clone, have never smelled that, but I have smelled In the Stars (which I don't like), and it does smell very similar. Maybe I don't like BKR540 DNA, could be because I feel like I do smell it a lot on other people. It does smell like cotton candy. I do like Cloud though, the dry down is similar, but the initial spray is very different and I like Cloud better. I gave this to my mom since she liked it.

l'eau D'Issey - 7/10 Reminds me of Baygon at initial spray, long-lasting fresh floral scent after

Omnia Amethyst - 7/10 Was planning to gift this for my brother's birthday, since he wanted a baby powder scent and I heard people say this smells like it. Very floral. This smells exactly like the perfume my grandmother wears going to church when I was younger, I teared up a little when I realize that was what it reminded me of. 🥲 I'll give this to her instead and gift my brother makeup 

Burberry Her - 6/10 - Fruity women's perfume, I feel like I smell this on people a lot.

Pure XS - 10/10 -  This smells sexy! I read that most people find Black Opium to be a super sexy scent, but Pure XS smells more attractive to me. Also my favourite bottle. 

Miss Dior Blooming Bouquet - 8/10 - My first rose fragrance that made me realize I like rose scents, smells fresh!

Won't talk more about the minis, decants and samples, but my fave among them are L'imperatice Limited Edition, Prada Candy, Crystal Noir! Those are 10/10 to me ",https://i.redd.it/0dyx5v4ikwve1.jpeg,793,126,Review,"cloud, mac","local, international","powder, blush, makeup",,2025-04-20,Neutral
1gb4cd7,"I finally stopped buying makeup products One time I was just doomscrolling on underconsumption tiktok, napaisip ako, “gusto ko rin makaubos ng makeup, I wanna hit pan too.” But despite this, I still got enticed with new releases and high end makeups from time to time, lalo na now that I have money of my own. 

Essentially hindi nag-work ang doomscrolling, so I made an excel of all the products I own—per category, anong brand, anong shade, how much each product is, etc. Hindi ko na tinapos kasi andami tapos nakaka-40K na ako. Sabi ko last na, after ko bilhin yung mga nasa wishlist ko, tama na. No buy na for real. 

I just realized wala nang content creators sa FYP ko, pag sa mall hindi na ako pumapasok sa stores to “just look”, I even stopped browsing online, not aware of the new launches and everything. Ngayon napapa-reflect ako LOL, hindi naman nga ako content creator to have all those makeup eh pare-pareho lang naman yung look na ginagawa ko. And I found products that work for me—some tinatry ko na lang to work kasi sayang. I’d rather save my money and spend on something else, basta tama na sa makeup hahaha. 

May ina-eye pa rin akong makeup like a dior blush, dior palette, hourglass palette; but that’s just what they are now—makeup cravings. Di naman yan sila aalis. Lol.

1hd3qqk,"Are you doing a no buy/low buy in 2025? Context: 2023 was my year of makeup/skincare splurge. As in I switched to almost highend brands na talaga. By the end of the year, I tried tallying everything I bought but stopped when the numbers reached xx,xxx mark. I was already disgusted with myself. So I decided to do a low buy in 2024. I know myself enough and alam kong mahihirapan akong mag-quit cold turkey, that I am going to resent myself if hindi ko siya magawa nang maayos. 

My low buy rule this year was just being more mindful of my purchases, less impulse buys. By March, I also started my Project Pan and I have been doing so well with it. Exciting makaubos ng products pala!

Two weeks ago, I did the math again and happy to report that I was able to cut my 2024 spending in half! What helped is also removing my cc details in online shopping apps. Considering I went to Japan and Thailand this year (skincare and makeup mecca hehe), I only got few items that are well-thought out of/restocks of items I use. Ngayong December, nabili ko na lahat ng gusto ko except for 1 lip product! I am less tempted to buy makeup and less na rin ang FOMO.

So in 2025, I’m doing another low buy with better rules:

- No new makeup (I can buy Violette FR Bisou Balm only if I finish my DHC lip balm, Dior lip balm and Clinique Black Honey lip balm since they’re all lip balms lol)

- No new skincare, haircare and bodycare unless they’re restock

- No new perfume (ang sakit)

- 1 piece of clothing is only allowed per month (1 in, 1 out rule) If I buy something, I need to let go of something

- I can buy 1 want per quarter (of any item)

- My credit card will only be used for 
necessities (ex: grocery), for any “wants”, I have to use my debit card

Non-beauty related rules, share ko na lang din:

- Limit eating out to twice a month, “deserve ko ‘to” food/deliveries only during sweldo day, di mo laging deserve anteh 😆

- 1 movie per month (except during Cinemalaya month)

- I can only buy mga pinag-isipang maiging products/restocks during travels

Sino pa mag-low buy/no buy sa inyo? What are the rules/restrictions you have set for yourself? Will you be giving “penalties” ba if you break your rules? haha I’m thinking about adding one like if di ko mapigilan sarili ko, I have to put the same amount ng gusto ko bilhin sa savings ko since the whole idea is to save more and declutter by actually using all my products.

I also told my sister and 1 friend about this since sila ung mga nambubudol sa kin to not keep me in the loop with new makeup and movie releases.

Ayun.

1ddwwz9,"Mga kuripot of r/beautytalkph what are the products and tips you swear by? • you don't need a separate eye cream, putting extra layer of your usual night moisturizer on the eye area is enough and cheaper by the ml.

• Careline liquid pen eyeliner is budge/water proof and available in most supermarkets. As a busy working mom, very practical sa time and budget.

• Dermazole is a cheaper generic version of Nizoral that's easily available in most drugstores. It's a tiny bottle, but since you'll only use it twice a week and less often once itchy/flaky scalp is managed, it can actually last for months.

• Oatmeal based baby wash also works for adults with eczema. No need to spend a lot on body wash marketed specifically for eczema

Edit: dalawa pa pala! 

• just because it has a high price tag doesn't mean maganda na. Always read multiple reviews before splurging.

• Formulation is more important than the brand. Reviewing the ingredient list on CosDNA for irritants is great.

1dl0eaf,"Currently in my lazy girl phase. I know some of you went from taking 3 hours just to get ready to 30 mins lang tapos na. I am one of them! 
As I got older, pasimple ng pasimple yung beauty routine ko. Not sure kung katamaran or wala lang energy haha. I eventually quit dyeing my hair kahit may urge ako magpahighlights because of social media. Kahit boxed dyes sa watsons di ko na pinapansin. I refuse to have a hair cut since it kinda feels…. Liberating. 😂 Before laging patay hair ko because of all the impulsive bleaching and color changes, inubos ko na ata yung ROYGBV sa rainbow. I do wear ~minimal~ makeup and i wanna share my go-to everyday products here:

-base: vice co. blurrfection skin tint in freshnezz, sunnies SSG multistick in seashell, sunnies powder in flax, la girl peach corrector for my dark circles

-eyes: sunnies easyline, vice co soft gaze eyeshadow in pink dawn (pag formal events lang usually)

-lips: sunnies fluffbalm in perfect mauve (my only pangharabas lippie that goes with my complexion)

-brows: sunnies lifebrow pomade pencil and brow gel (their brow gel is so good i swear partida my kilay is sparse)

-cheeks: vice co glow spell in rosé, canmake munyutto in moonlight gem, vice co blush mood in soft mauve, sunnies airblush in pixie for a natural flush

My lazy routine consists of one of each of the products above, but sometimes i just do sunscreen pag sobrang tinatamad na (my fave is beauty of joseon, yung nasa tube form!) Sometimes less is more 💖 I know marami akong karamay na lazy girls with their holy grail out there, hiii!

1le1icg,"I recently started taking care of my lips and it changed my makeup game I never really paid much attention to lip care. It always felt a bit overhyped to me. I also used to think most lip products were basically the same, especially tints. Like, they’re just… tints. I couldn’t be bothered to spend that much on lip products because I thought the differences aren’t that noticeable. But I was very wrong. 

I’ve always had naturally full lips, and I thought that was enough. What bothered me though was how dry and two-toned they looked. I didn’t think there was much I could do about it, so I just ignored it and focused more on the makeup part.

Then last month, I randomly came across this TikTok influencer with such plump, hydrated, and pink lips. She was sharing her lip combos, so I tried copying them. Obviously didn’t look the same on me lol. Even though she has lip fillers and got her lips tattooed, she also clearly takes care of them. That was my turning point. I suddenly found myself deep in a rabbit hole about lip care, hydration, and how to actually make lips look healthy. Not just covered up. I ended up buying a few products and started incorporating them into my nee lip care routine. And honestly? Game changer.

As someone who has always been a matte lipstick girly, I didn’t realize how bad matte lips looked on me when my lips were dry (which was basically all the time). But now that I actually hydrate and prep them, everything just applies and wears better. Sounds like common sense, but I didn’t really get it until I saw the difference myself.

Before this, I hated how glosses or shiny lip products looked on me. I didn’t own a single gloss or satin lipstick because they always made my lips look weird and emphasized texture. My stash was literally all matte. And for tints, I’d just use those ₱30–₱50 ones from random local shops. I also used to over-conceal my lips and heavily line them with a pale lip liner just to force a clean gradient look. In pictures they looked okay,  but in real life it always ended up looking dry, cakey, and off.

Now? I actually love how my bare lips look. I can finally wear glosses, juicy lip tints, and combos that aren’t matte without feeling insecure about how they’ll sit on my lips. So if you’re anything like me and thought lip care wasn’t a big deal, this is your sign to start. Trust me, it makes a huge difference.

Here are some product that are now staples for me: 

1. Rhode Peptide Lip Treatment – I hate how much I love this. It’s pricey but (unfortunately) it works. You’ll only get it once you try it. If you guys know actual local dupes, I’d love to try it.
2. Vaseline Lip Therapy (Rosy) – This one shocked me. I layer it on before bed and wake up with soft, pink lips every time. Super simple, super effective.
3. Happy Skin Lip Mallow and Water Tint – I used to gaslight myself into thinking the ₱50 tints were fine, but they dried my lips like crazy. These tints feel way more hydrating, the color payoff is so much better, and they actually last longer. My lips are still stained even after eating oily meals. Hindi na mukhang sassa gurl na nagsesettle lang yung color sa gitna ng lips.
4. Detail Lip Liner (esp. the shade Baby) - My fave MLBB lip liner! Wala akong masabi, basta sobrang ganda. Wouldn’t say it’s longwearing, but pwede na. Sulit na sulit for its price.

That’s my little lip care awakening. If you’ve ever felt like lip products just don’t work for you, maybe it’s not your lips. Maybe they just need a little more love. 

And if you have any recos, please send them my way!

🫡 Pinkflash NO4/RO1 lasting matte lipcream - 6.5/10 I don’t really use this lipstick as often anymore but I liked that it is inexpensive and buildable. It also lasts really long, mattifying yet will not dry your lips. However, it looks powdery and does not cover your lips well.

💀Sheglam Pink Flamingo Lip plumper - 2/10 This was in my for you page for so long and I watched so many influencers say that this product is so good but girl it ISNT GIVING! I dont like how it feels on my lips. I don’t like the smell. It looks kinda good on the lips but only on camera. Looks like a mess irl and I wouldnt wear it anywhere


👌 Romand Ruddy Nude Zero Matte Lipstick - 7/10 One of my favorites that I use to blur my lips but the only thing I dont like about it is that it isnt transfer proof. It is really pigmented though and buildable

💅 Romand Burnt Orange Blur Fudge Tint - 10/10 feels like I have nothing on my lips, it has a decent smell and I love how lightweight yet pigmented it is. This is truly transfer proof!

💀 GRWM Strawberry Tinted Lip Glaze - 3/10 feels cold on the lips, bought it like the sheglam, saw it on my feed and it looked good on influencers but it didnt really looked good upon application. When I wear this, I let it sit on my lips for 2 minutes then rub off the excess to reveal the tint and just put lip balm. It’s really hard to blend it.

🫡GRWM Vodka/Sangria lip booze sheer balm - 5/10 another budol of mine, again looked really good in camera and was hyped greatly but it’s mediocre. Although theyre different shades, both actually look the same on my lip

👌 Happy Skin Routine Lip Cloud matte lipstick - 8/10 I like the formula, feels lightweight I just don’t use it as often as I should  and it isn’t transfer proof

💯 Nivea Cherry Shine Lip Balm -10/10 been using this lip balm since I was in sixth grade, no way I am letting this go lmao it’s the goat

💯 Dior Addict RoseWood Lip Glow - 10/10, perfect absolutely perfect…This is the first time I bought my own high end product.

1k3rrae,"What are the CHEAP makeup products you swear by? I'll go first, dahil feel ko nagttreasure hunt ako pag bumibili ng super mura na makeup online (as much as possible yung FDA approved). For reference, I have both high-end, mid-tier and cheap makeup. I just really like scrolling down on shopee and tiktok to find alternatives for the expensive stuff I use. 🤣

1. Biya Eyebrow Pen. (Less than 50 pesos!) - Long lasting! Smooth yung tip. Pero, nagtatae na siya bandang dulo like a drop of ink comes out first and it becomes hard to control so I always swatch it on the back of my hand or wipe it off before applying. Another con is that nasisira agad yung body ng pen, pero keribells. I used this for my brows, eyeliner and aegyo sal. Also, IDK if FDA approved siya hahaha.

Used as an alternative to - Issy and Co's eyebrow pen. Nasira din packaging ng Issy sakin but issy was less opaque, thinner brush and pen, equally long lasting. Couldn't use it as eyeliner though since it was too light but it was perfect for aegyo sal. 

2. Eyeshadow Quad ng Pretty Secret (99 pesos) - Holy cow, ang ganda ng shades. Holy grail ko yung brown palette, very basic warm shades but they do the job for an everyday look! Ang problema ko lang dito, madali ulit masira yung packaging and nabasag agad nung nalaglag. 😭 Pero love na love ko yung shades. Walang highlight shade yung brown palette though. Nasa pink palette. And puro warm tone yung brown palette. 

Used as an alternative to - The naked 2 palette, the formulas are not comparable at all and the longevity. Mas maganda ang naked and less fall out. Pero I only use a few shades in this palette. The black one, bronze one, the taupe one and the light gold one. 🤣 Pretty Secret is not on par with this palette but it's a good choice for an everyday budget palette.  

3. The saem concealer (less than 150 pesos) - My holy grail concealer, does the job and lasts long. There was a time nung una kong gamit where it caked on me though but after a while nag-adjust na yata idk for some reason naging perfect na siya. Hindi lang to blurring or hydrating though. It covers and stays on. That's it. It's tiny but lasts a bit of a while naman on me. 

Used as an alternative to - Nars Creamy Concealer and Naturactor. Naturactor's finish is so natural, the saem does the same. Naturactor is just a tad bit more blurring. Nars is way more hydrating and comfortable on the skin than the saem, pero kung tatakpan lang eyebags ko at di naman dry skin ko okay na yung the saem. Ayoko na bumili ng sobrang mahal. 🤣 (I'd repurchase nars for the glowy and smooth finish though.) 

4. Dazzle me Lock and Wing Eyeliner (150 pesos) - Long lasting, opaque, dries quickly, walang issue! I love it! Bet ko pa how it's boxy and the brush tip is fine and thin. Hindi nagtatae, sobrang dali magdraw ng line. 

Alternative ko to for Maybelline's Tattoo Liner, when you leave this thing open by accident it dries the whole eyeliner agad. Sayang 300 pesos. 

5. DC Formulations soft creamy blush (100+) - I actually prefer this over my pau unating blush, kasi that one kind of leaks and becomes dry over time (still my holy grail tho) pero pansin ko this one is equally long lasting and it's very smooth upon application, easier to use than peauty beauty's blush (but peauty has prettier shades talaga imo, and peauty sticks like cement - tho peauty gets cakey when applied wrong)

Alternative ko for Peauty to haha.
----
Save your money, don't buy these.

Pinkflash lipgloss and eyebrow pencil (less than 100 pesos) - Hell no! Ang thick, uncomfortable, and tastes like plastic and smells artificial. 😭 The eyebrow pencil is waxy, too creamy, gets wiped off. 

Yun palang... I don't buy brands na i can't trust, took a leap of faith with pinkflash oks naman yung eyeliner but I will not be buying from them again. 

Sunnies - those pot blushes - NAGKAMOLD after a couple months! Depende sa shade yung molding ng blushes na to. 😭 Nagka-mold yung bronzer shade pero yung pink shade hindi and I bought them on the same day naman. Ngl they last on my face naman pero THE MOLD. 

I love sunnies tho, medyo trial and error lang yung ibang base products nila pero the finish is always gorg.

1m894gl,"Aesthetic clinic horror stories Just want to share my experience working in an aesthetic clinic.
For context, I am a registered nurse and I landed on a job at an aesthetic clinic which has multiple branches all over Luzon. I was performing non-surgical procedures including face threads and fillers.

I just want everyone to be very careful on the services you avail in the clinics you go to so here are some stuff you should know 
(THIS IS JUST BASED FROM THE CLINIC I USED TO WORK IN, IT DOES NOT REFLECT TO OTHERS)

Gluta 
- They just administer plain vitamin B12, they would even split a single ampule for two clients 
- If you do ask what would be infused, they have actual gluta vials to show but it's company policy not to show how they dilute them for your use
-  I have heard how they tried to reuse an IV set because there wasn’t enough on-hand stocks 
- The ""alcohol"" they use for cotton balls is just scented water that has a cool effect to mimic alcohol

Facials
- The sponges for cleansing are reused. I have seen ones that have mold on them, they just wash them with either dishwashing soap or laundry powder to be used for the next client
- Face masks and carbon gel used for laser are just the typical ones you get from the orange app 

Botox
- Vials are not stored properly onced open, they would be placed in room temperature since they didn't have refrigerators for them
- They would dilute them with more solution than directed so it could cater to more clients (not technically harmful but it looses its potency)

Mesolipo
- Measurements of before and after are altered, they would fold measuring tapes to make it seem like you get insant results
- I have asked them before if clients actually get slimmer from the treatment, they said not really

Client reviews
- Some reviews they post on their social media are fake, literally just edited and written by them

As I have mentioned, I was performing face threads and filler (hiko nose, fox eye, lip and chin filler, etc.) 
- They said that I am legally allowed to perform them because of my nursing license but there would be times wherein clients get the impression that I am a doctor because the staff would call me ""doc"" and I wouldn't be able to correct them unless the clients ask because then they might back out from the procedure
- Some of my co-nurses weren't licensed nor studied in the medical field although we all undergone training but it was not that intensive. I did a day of lecture and and another for practicals, followed by a week of observing other nurses perform but mostly I just did my own research and learned through practice on actual clients
- We were under the supervision of an actual doctor but it was just through the phone
- We were not provided supplies to properly clean our instruments and no sterile gloves were given, only clean ones 

I have raised these concerns to them before and in their defense:
- We would not be at fault since we don't actually introduce ourselves as doctors. If clients assume that we are then it's their fault 
- They consider the procedures as minimally-invasive and non-sterile so there is no need for a sterile field

Anyway, I no longer work for the company mainly because the services they offered weren't even something that I would agree to perform on me much more would I recommend to my friends and family

I apologize if I am not able to disclose the clinic because apparently I could get fined by them if they figured that I am the one posting this which is likely

Please be very careful, do your own research, and ask your providers a lot of questions (that also kinda annoys them lol)",https://www.reddit.com/r/beautytalkph/comments/1m894gl/aesthetic_clinic_horror_stories/,630,142,PSA,vice,local,"powder, sponge, sponges",,2025-07-24,Neutral

1hl7rz8,"Favorite budgetarian finds of 2024 Criteria: less than 1k
- Discovered or started using it just 2024 lang

I’ll start:
1. Naturactor. My friend gave this to me and sobrang tipid gamitin. It’s my everyday concealer for the whole year. You need to set this, pero sa sobrang tipid gamitin and di mabigat ok na ako reapply.

2. Maxifine eyebrow. It’s around 39 pesos and it works. Mabilis lang maubos, pero as someone who can’t justify mga 100 plus na sobrang bilis maubos or maputol, goods na ako dito hoard ko na lang.

3. Detail lip liner. It’s sturdy and it’s creamy. For the price talaga, sobrang winner na nito. Actually bought this with the velvet lipstick. Nabubura na lipstick pero staying strong pa rin lip liner.

4. Luxe Organix soft lips. HG!! Parang buong year ito talaga savior ng lips ko. 

5. Pinkflash stamp eyeliner. Sa mga no talent talaga mag cat eye ito na. Doesn’t budge and easy to use.
6. Luxe organix 24hr lip serum. It’s cheap and it’s easy to find. Minsan yan lang need ko. It’s effective and moisturizing my lips so I will repurchase all year round.
7. The originote lip serum. Bigay ng friend ko to. This isn’t a Filipino brand but it’s on shopee for less than 200. The smell kinda bothers me pero it saved my lips nung nag Iceland ako kaya staple na rin siya. 
8. Detail lip plumper. As a lip plumper I won’t say it’s the best. Pero as a lip oil, really makes my lips look healthy and moisturized
9. EB lip oil. Made so many praise for this na. Basta sobrang ganda nito. The shades burnt caramel and glass slippers give me that perfect stain pa.

10. EB liquid pop. I think I’ve said all the praises for this na. Ginawa ko na siya Christmas gift rin sa sobrang love ko sa kanya.

11. Hello Glow magic tint. My natural flush blush. When in doubt, ito talaga

12. L’oreal Color Riche in 601. As a longtime user of CT Pillowtalk, I love this shade more. It’s not transferproof pero ok lang kasi it’s not drying.

13. L’oreal Infallible Matte Resistance. While Maybelline is stronger, this is not as drying and it’s creamier to apply. L’oreal bumalik na po kayo sa department stores

14. Careline eyelashes. It won’t replace my heroine make, pero it doesn’t budge and it doesn’t give me panda eyes so ito na ginagamit ko for everyday

15. Palmer’s cocoa butter lotion and body oil. Use then simultaneously, made my skin super soft and smell real good

16. Naturie skin condition. Ang tipid nito and made my skin super soft. As an oily skin girlie ok siya for me kasi mabilis siya mag absorb

17. Luxe organix sunstick. Super matte nito so as an oily girlie I stand by this

18. Hello Glow ultralight matte sunscreen. Affordable, no whitecast, finishes matte on me. Wala ako hinihiling pa from a cheap sunscreen

19. Vaseline serum lotion. Brightens my skin and keeps it moisturize

20. Choco musk perfume. My cheapest perfume pero mygawd. Hinahanap hanap ng mga tao amoy ko. Nahabol na ako sa mall kasi merong gusto mag tanong ano pabango ko.

my favorite things about it:


• it doesn't have the usual waxy lipstick smell, it smells like marshmallows


• it's matte but not drying at all, was surprised at how good the formula is. I think it's more of a velvet matte, maybe?


• it gives the trending blurry lip effect (I feel like it's giving fwee blurry pudding pot / aou floofy matte balm but in lipstick form)


• pretty shades 💗 sweet pea is a baby pink and maple candy is a brownish pink according to eb


• simple packaging but doesn’t feel cheap and looks cute 


• local brand that already has a great reputation

18vrab8,"A Happy Brows rant. Or, on how I got a bald right eyebrow after using their castor oil TLDR: 
Happy Brows serum gave me alopecia, and they're taking a while to take responsibility for me. And they're very unresponsive. 
A product that claims it's organic - doesn't mean it can never do damage. 
Minoxidil is the scientifically proven to grow hair (castor oil isn't) but it needs caution to be used for eyebrows. 
On another topic, Happy Brows' lash extensions aren't very good haha 

Oct 14-Nov 4. I was sold (they really did sales talk on me: persuasive, repeating, touching on my insecurity cos I overshaved my brow awkwardly) their Happy Brows Brow Serum which I started to use nightly on half of my right brow only (so my left is a control group. First half lang cos that's where I overshaved. Not every night cos I forget. 
Saw on Nov 4 that it started to get thinner so I STOPPED. My left brow, which didn't use the serum, is as good as ever. That serum was the only thing I used in the right brow. I also know that I don't have an allergy to castor oil cos I've used it before for lashes and saw no adverse effect. I wish I stopped earlier, but I had no way of knowing because it only started to thin on Nov 4, my photo from Oct 31 showed it was ok.

Nov 4-Dec 12. The sparseness eventually turned into baldness, which is getting worse, without me doing anything (except for using brow pencil on the few times I go out). The skin in the brow area was also whiter, where there should be pigmentation. 

Dec 1-18. Was contacting them in their FB page, following up A LOT on different days. They were so frustratingly unresponsive! Most of the time just automated replies - no reply. Only a few times replying that their customer service will get in touch with me soon. 

Dec 12. I went to a board certified derm who diagnosed me with ""irritant dermatitis resulting to alopecia of right eyebrow 2° to serum use"", assured me that we're certain about the serum being the culprit (cos it's the only thing I used), and that its ingredient was ""matindi"". Prescribed me corticosteroid to stop the still ongoing inflammation & irritation, and with much precautions - minoxidil. Which is a medically & scientifically proven way to grow hair thicker. Which castor oil isn't. 

Dec 19. I followed up in FB messenger of their page cos they still haven't called me. 

Dec 20. Finally, area manager texted on Viber & manager called me, both telling me to come to the branch. Said they'll give me a free service. They didn't advise me on what to bring.

Dec 21. I came to the branch. They really don't believe me that their serum caused this, that I'm the only one who complained about it!! The way they told me that - was giving ✨ gaslighting ✨. The manager offered again their other services but I declined, cos I'd rather have the compensation in cash. and I reallyyy don't want their services.
 I chatted a stranger who was complaining in their FB (by angry react-ing) who told me : ""Hndi kasi mgnda pagkagawa sa eyelash extension. Iisa lang din ang gumagawa tatlo oras yata ako nkahiga nun"". 
And I also have a friend who had an unsatisfactory eyelash extension cos they used too much glue, and it was too heavy that she ended up having it removed. After MUCH MUCH talking & waiting, the manager told me to come back with my derma's prescription. 

Dec 30. I brought the medical certificate from the derma.
3-4 - I came back to the branch at 3pm but the manager (a different one this time) was out for lunch break. I waited for 1 hour. 

4-4:45 - When she came back, she forgot to tend to me (even though the other staff chatted her that I'm here waiting for her) (I was the only customer inside) and attended a mall admin orientation so I waited even more for 45 minutes. The other staff really blamed me (with an annoying tone) for not giving an advance notice that I'll come back today (gurl they told me before I can come back anytime).  They are all still in denial that their serum did this to me, even suggesting that my condition is made worse by what I'm applying now (hallurrr yun po yung prescribed by a derma)

4:45-5 - Spent talking with the manager and waiting on her decision. She's also kept on invalidating my experience with the serum. She told me to come back with/send online the receipts of my derma consultation & prescriptions, which I wish they told me online before I came to the branch and wasted a lot of time, but I sent a receipt right away anyway. And she also blamed me for complaining late (madam puhlease I was trying to reach your head office online for 2 weeks, I didn't go to your physical branch agad cos I knew that in the end, the head office will decide, not you). I eventually agreed to be compensated with free service but she called the area manager who then said to wait for the head office's decision, and I can't avail of the free service anymore just yet (which... the other manager already repeatedly offered me before) 

Maybe I'm in the wrong for not patch testing in case I have an allergy or adverse reaction. But walang advisory sa packaging nila to do that first. And even if I did, the adverse reaction came 2 weeks after pa.

WALA rin sa packaging ang: expiry date and manufactured date. I also dunno if it was FDA approved or something. Yeah I certainly was in the wrong for trusting this product lmao. 

Maybe I'm in the wrong kasi ako lang yung may ganitong adverse reaction, out of all their customers, or so they claim. Still?? Shouldn't they still take responsibility for me, lalo na ang lala nung nangyari sakin? As in mukhang nasunog, di ko na makita yung follicles (though the derma said the follicles are still, always, there) 

At this point I'm still waiting for them just cos I'm in denial that I lost my right brow (and so many hours waiting and repeatedly talking to an invalidating staff) all for nothing, for no reimbursement. Nakakahinayang yung oras ko, maybe I should've just let it go. Not to mention I'm really non confrontational so this is such a taxing experience for me ha ha 

Anyway does anyone have advice on how to cope with a bald brow 😂
Currently using ELF Instant lift eye brow pen. Which is wayyy better than Mumuso, 3w clinic, face shop (tho baka fake yung akin) - which all fade quickly 
I was discouraged by the derma to do tattoo cos baka magka irritation ulit. Or oral minoxidil, cos it would cause growth in other areas. Or injected minoxidil, cos it's expensive.

1ggd6rz,"BEST LOOSE POWDER FOR VERY OILY SKIN!! As a 19-year-old student with very sensitive, acne-prone, combination skin, I've been experimenting with makeup since I was 15, trying to find products that suit my needs. I often deal with both dryness and excessive oiliness and bumps on my face, which makes it challenging to find the right powder. 

Recently, I visited a department store and tested several local brands, including GRWM, Sunnies, BLK, and Issy and Co. I found GRWM to be patchy for me, while Sunnies and BLK were decent. I wasn't particularly impressed with Issy and Co., thinking it was just overhyped, but on a whim, I tried their Weightless Loose Mattifying Powder under my eyes. To my surprise, it didn't crease, even after I got home. 

I decided to buy the Weightless Loose Mattifying Powder even if it's a bit pricey, hoping it will work for me in the long run. When I tested it at school (school air), I noticed a significant difference. Normally, I'd need to blot my makeup two times before lunch and retouch, which often ended up looking cakey and patchy. However, with the Issy and Co. powder, I only needed to use one blotting paper by the time I was heading home! I can't believe I went so long without this product, as it really transformed my makeup routine. 

I didn't even need a setting spray! Overall, the mattifying effect and oil control are impressive. I just wanted to share my experience in hopes that it helps others who face similar problem with very oily skin. ✅

I bought Careline Contour Stick and GRWM Milk Tint back in 2023 but I still haven't used them up. Tatagal pa yata to hanggang next year 😭

I've been using Sassy Colors Powder Blush since last year. It's good naman and lasts me maximum of 6-7 hours (normal to dry skin) but I probably wouldn't repurchased the same shade.

My most repurchased products would be the EB Ultimate Brow Fix, Fashion 21 Mascara, Colourette Colourdrip, and Naturale OBMP.

As someone who doesn't know how to do my brows, I just use the EB Ultimate Brow Fix and yeah it works well for its price naman. I don't buy any other mascaras anymore ever since I've tried the Fashion 21 Mascara. It doesn't give me panda eyes and I like that it makes my lashes look natural and not overdone.

For the lips, the best local product (quality and price-wise) for me would be Naturale!! Their OBMP Matte Stain and Get glossed are really underated. It can be drying sometimes if I didn't prep my lips but the OBMP in Acacia is my mlbb so I keep on repurchasing it (5 na yata empties ko nito 😭)

Lastly, Colourette Colourdrip is the only lip oil I've tried that works on my dry lips. It has such a good formula but their previous packaging leaks. I heard they improved their packaging now.

kiko double touch liquid 131 - may slight saturation. deep color but not too much. goes well with issy cowgirl and becomes a bit more greyish

— next 3 are very similar but go from cool to warm —

kiko 3d hydra 35 - halatang fave ko kasi paubos na. perfect pang everyday kasi nakaka enhance ng natural lip color ko. this and kizz iz it = latina. has glitter that stays sa lips pag nabura lang, but it’s the most hydrating and long lasting for me

rom&nd glasting dim mauve - not like it looks sa packaging, medyo peachy siya, just slightly darker, warmer and less hydrating than kiko 3d hydra 35. i’d use this over the latter with my peachy blush

sunnies lip glaze bonbon - just a tad bit peachier and darker than rom&nd dim mauve. madali mawala pigment sa lips, and also slightly less hydrating than kiko 3d hydra

— next 2 are the most muted, local shades i’ve found —

issy hydragloss cowgirl - kind of a purple-brown, and muted sya! not very pigmented sa lips and has the consistency of lip oil, feels kinda dry

vice dew it all always servin’ - muted but ONLY if you use a little, and blend it with foundation on. for some reason ang saturated nya if you put too much and on bare skin. perpuk so much otherwise, yun nga lang it doesn’t last long",https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lhikz1,554,48,Swatches,"colourette, sunnies, issy, vice","local, local, local, local","foundation, blush, blushes, brow, lip liner, lip liners",,2025-06-22,Neutral

18rqqxu,"#NeverAgain Belo! I wanted to share my experience with Belo Medical Group, to help others who may want to consider their services. 5 months ago, I visited Belo to address my acne concern. I have moderate acne and oily skin. I was prescribed with the ff. skin care routine.

**AM:**

Glycolic Soap 5%

ZO Salicylic Acid Oil Control Pads

Acne Astringent

Inno-Derma Oil Defense Sunscreen

&#x200B;

**PM**:

Glycolic Soap 5%

ZO Salicylic Acid Oil Control Pads

Acne Astringent

Alternating Tretinoin 0.05% and Acne Drying Cream

&#x200B;

For the procedures: it’s the regular Glycopeel Cleaning and Spanish Peel.

&#x200B;

Unfortunately, the results didn’t go well. My skin worsened, I have more active pimples leaving more pimple marks, skin became more oily and the skin tone in my face became darker that doesn’t match my neck!

Despite my concerns, their dermatologist claimed that my skin improved, which obviously, I found hard to believe. They offered me an expensive procedure to address the pimple marks. I’m really disappointed because, their offering me another treatment to address a skin problem that they themselves have caused.

Thanks to this Reddit Community, that I discovered that Belo’s approach contradicted the recommendations of other dermatologists. For instance, Belo doesn’t allow to use moisturizers and introducing too many active ingredients alongside with the tretinoin at the beginning of the treatment; intead of starting slowly. I’m also alarmed to learn that they're not board-certified dermatologists.

Acting to the suggestions from this community, I consulted a board-certified dermatologist in SLMC and this is the best decision I’ve made. The new routine is very simple and cost effective; on top of that the products are available in the pharmacies. Three weeks have passed, and I can already see significant improvements. The pimple marks caused by Belo’s treatment already lightens and my skin tone is back to normal. I can already see significant improvement in my oily skin. My acne is not yet clear and I’m still getting few pimples, but I believe this is part of the purging phase since I was prescribed with a new type of retinoid (i.e., Oral Isotretinoin). I’m not bothered since the pimples heal fast in just a few days; and I'm under the guidance of a board-certified dermatologist. Hopefully, my skin concern will be completely address after few months of sticking with my new routine.

Expensive skin care doesn’t guarantee effectiveness. Be wary of celebrities who endorsed these beauty clinics since most likely these are paid promotions. Always consult a board-certified dermatologist for reliable advice and cost-effective treatment.

1kz5i11,"grunge fairy makeup🧚‍♀️ Sorry for the awkward poses, lol. I only meant to send these pics to my friends, but really liked how it turned out and decided to post here!

Photos 1 & 2 taken in indirect sunlight. Photo 3 taken about 4 hours later in artificial lighting.

**PRODUCTS USED**

1. **Issy Active Skin Tint** (Fawn) - This is the only base makeup I own, but I love it. It's so lightweight and the light coverage is perfect for just evening out my skin tone. I like the glowy finish and the slight cooling feeling when you put it on. Highly recommend.
2. **Issy Active Concealer** (PL2) - I just use a peach corrector for my under eyes. This one doesn't crease much for me and isn't cakey. Super reliable, will always repurchase this.
3. **GRWM Milk Tint** (Pudding) - A cute peachy liquid blush, lasts long if you set it. Easy to use and blends really well.
4. **Peripera Sunshine Cheek Blush** (01 Calm Pink) - The only powder blush I own. Just use it to set my liquid blush. Pretty sheer, you'd need to build it up if you want more pigment, which I like since I'm scared I have blush blindness lol. Overall though, I wouldn't really recommend it. It's fine, but I'm sure there are better powder blushes out there.
5. **Issy Pressed Shadow Single** (Absinthe, Patina) - Last row of my palette. Suuuper love these shimmer shadows. Their other shades are really good too (3rd row: Delirium, Metamorphosis, Electronica). I wanna get more. They payoff is incredible. Used Absinthe for the main lid then Patina for the outer edges. Get these shimmers!! (The mattes are good but have a lot of fall out in case that bothers you.)
6. **Romand Better Than Palette** (01 Pampas Garden) - Just used the shade Deep Brownie (bottom rightmost) for my wing. I really love this palette for the dazzling glitters, though! Great shade range. Worth it purchase.
7. **Issy Gel Pencil Extreme** (Black Belt) - Love using this for my waterline. It really is budge proof, so you'll have to work quickly if you wanna do any smudging. I find it not the easiest to work with. I'm not sure I'd repurchase this. I've tried so many gel liners and I still just haven't found the one so if you have recommendations, please let me know!!
8. **Vice Co. Perfect Kizz Lip Liner** (Last Kizz) - Super creamy and smudge proof. Love how this glides. I just wish they had more variety in their shade range.
9. **Issy Gelee Lip Tint** (Baddie) - I love this shade so much I could cry. My pictures don't do it justice. It's a darker more grungy shade which is my fav lippie vibe. The formula on the other hand is fine. It's not the most long-lasting, and it's weird that it's called a tint because it doesn't really leave a stain at all. If you guys have other lippie recos in similar shades, drop them below!

No brow products because idk how to do my brows😭 I recently just bought the Detail Cosmetics Superfine Liner in Latte though, so I'll see how that turns out.

1bp4e94,"my affordable skin care routine as a broke student (with prices) as a pagod at kuripot na student, i set a resolution in 2023 to learn basic make-up and skincare routines to improve my acne and have the skills to prepare myself for events while spending minimal money on products i would purchase. with lots of help and research from this sub, i can finally say i've reached a point where i can do simple make-up for events or lakwatsas and my skin is the clearest it has been (considering my stress in med school).

with that, here is a run down of the products i use, where i bought them, and their price. most things here are under 250 pesos each and have last me a long time (4 months to 1 year). this is something i wish i had when i was just starting to out, and i hope this helps any one else beginning their routines!

**skincare**

* cleanser: [Dermorepubliq Clarifying Gentle Face Wash Niacinamide + Botanical Extracts - 100 mL](https://shopee.ph/Dermorepubliq-Clarifying-Gentle-Face-Wash-Niacinamide-Botanical-Extracts-100-mL-i.339409991.9155382857?xptdk=139dab8b-80d1-4bcd-bffb-b820ffc4aa49) (Php 159)
   * i've been using this since 2021 and i'm on my fourth bottle, and i've also placed this in all the places i tend to sleep over because of how much i love it! so affordable and sulit since one bottle lasts 6 months for me when i use it twice a day. very mild and no stinging or beads that i find irritate my skin.
* niacinamide: [Dermorepubliq 10% Niacinamide + 3% Tranexamic Acid + 2% Alpha Arbutin Ultra White Serum - 30 mL](https://shopee.ph/Dermorepubliq-10-Niacinamide-3-Tranexamic-Acid-2-Alpha-Arbutin-Ultra-White-Serum-30-mL-i.339409991.18246123152?xptdk=9b389aa6-1f53-4ffa-8c50-abc52d111143) (Php 319)
   * started using this after my dermatologist recommended i try niacinamide to reduce my acne and i wanted an alternative to TO that was less expensive and more accessible to me since i saw here that there are so many online fakes :( this worked for me and i find it to be very mild with no stinging! already on my second bottle since i started using this in may 2022.
   * i previously used [Dermorepubliq 5% Niacinamide + Hyaluronic Acid Sensitive Skin Formula Serum - 30 mL](https://shopee.ph/Dermorepubliq-5-Niacinamide-Hyaluronic-Acid-Sensitive-Skin-Formula-Serum-30-mL-i.339409991.8964357378?xptdk=b75f2d68-5b79-4cc9-9dd9-d2b1cbda5479) (Php 215) however i find that the 10% one helps me control my acne better and improves my skin texture
* vitamin C: [Dermorepubliq 15% L-Ascorbic Acid + E + Ferulic Acid Brightening Formula Serum - 30 mL](https://shopee.ph/Dermorepubliq-15-L-Ascorbic-Acid-E-Ferulic-Acid-Brightening-Formula-Serum-30-mL-i.339409991.18925260092?sp_atk=dbf1fa1e-493c-4a5d-9861-1cc09d15822f&xptdk=dbf1fa1e-493c-4a5d-9861-1cc09d15822f) (Php 279)
   * bought this after i became conscious of my small bumps and acne marks + wanted to reduce the effects of stress on my face. i've noticed my face become softer since using and has overall contributed to controlling my breakouts. still on my first bottle since starting in august 2023, so very sulit talaga.
* ""moisturizer"": [Apollo Petroleum Jelly - 200g](https://shopee.ph/Apollo-Petroleum-Jelly-200G-i.267163785.7736323626?sp_atk=76b0849b-dd46-4840-bf3b-4bf4c0e63fed&xptdk=76b0849b-dd46-4840-bf3b-4bf4c0e63fed) (Php 200)
   * in quotation marks since this isn't really a moisturizer but i find it to be genuinely helpful in preventing dryness. started using this after my face got so dry nung naging aircon na lahat ng classrooms namin, especially around my nose and lip area. i no longer have cracking or peeling skin in those areas.
   * i also use this in my elbows and arms since those parts are often very dry too for me.
   * bought in grocery store, added link lang for accessibility!
* sunscreen: [Biore UV Watery Essence - 70g](https://www.watsons.com.ph/biore-uv-watery-essence-70g/p/BP_50033601) (Php 450-Php 557)
   * i'm not very picky with sun screen but this works for me, has no stinging or burning, and doesn't cook my face under the sun! i like the gel formula and it's the right amount of liquid and sticky to me. i also use this under my makeup as a primer and it keeps everything in place naman with no white cast (prior to this i used YOU sunscreen which gave me a white cast whoops)
   * tip-id: found this to be cheaper in S&R than in Watson's (less than Php 500)

**make-up**

* concealer and color corrector: [The Saem Perfection Tip Concealer SPF28 - 6.5g in 1.75, 3.0, and Green](https://shopee.ph/product/153457773/5117421781?d_id=348fe&fbclid=IwAR2rYj55V1DITWCl-fU-Bns09-uwaMiDutM_s86caKTiE35z8ARECc1YmsM&uls_trackid=4vcpvqfb00m8&utm_content=iUwRmujgyXCeoT3BV228LmPXNhm) (Php 195)
   * i know their shade range isn't the best, but if it suits you, i highly recommend this brand for their affordability and medium coverage that isn't too heavy, even during super humid season. i use the shade 1.75 which i bought from this shop for most of the year. i'm still using the same bottle i bought in january 2023 to this day since i still have a lot huhu
   * i also bought the 3.0 to mix with the 1.75 nung nangitim ako during the summer.
   * i also use their green color corrector for the redness around my nose and pimple marks. i've considered buying their pink color corrector but i think it won't help with my eyebags hahaha
   * tip-id: before committing to buying this, i tested out their sample in store on the back of my hand HAHAHAHA 350 sya sa store fsr kaya sa shopee na lang lmao
* blush: Clinique Chubby Stick in Robust Rhubarb (Php 1557)
   * the only expensive thing on this whole list kasi binigay lang to sa akin ng balikbayan kong tita slay po tita!!!
   * i prefer using cream blushes in general para portable and on the go, madali dalhin and i just use my fingers to apply. i honestly recommend this for beginners kasi i find it to be more stressful to use powder blushes that can crack or break and to use a whole brush since i'm more prone to breakouts when i use a make-up brush.
   * been using this for over 3 years and i still have a lot, so worth it pa rin. [link to a shop here in the Ph that sells it](https://www.cosmeticsnow.ph/iteminfo/clinique-chubby-stick-cheeks-colour-balm-no02-robust-rhubarb-6g)
* eyeliner: Eyeliner Stamp
   * tbh binigay lang din ito ni mamshie dearest <33 she mothered fr. [link to a similar one on shopee here](https://shopee.ph/SUNISA-1PCS-Double-Head-Waterproof-Eyeliner-Pen-Cat-Eye-Winged-Eye-Eyeliner-Cosmetic-Seal-Stamp-Wing-i.31233419.16280016598?publish_id=&sp_atk=47be94b1-e1db-4083-ab62-8152ad03d85c&xptdk=47be94b1-e1db-4083-ab62-8152ad03d85c)
   * the stamp part did not actually work for me and only really worked for one eye (since no one actually has symmetrical eyes!!!,) but it was still waterproof and still works for me. plus, now i have 2 eyeliner sticks, so it works out
* powder: [Dr. Sensitive All Day No Sebum Blur Powder - 25g](https://www.watsons.com.ph/all-day-no-sebum-blur-powder-25g/p/BP_50012874) (Php 169)
   * i use this as a ""setting powder"" of sorts when i really want my makeup to last all day. i find it effective and it prevents me from being oily. haven't used lately since it isn't portable enough for me but it works the way i need it to.
* lip gloss: [Human Nature Tinted Lip Balm in Flame Tree - 4g](https://www.watsons.com.ph/tinted-lip-balm-flame-tree-4g/p/BP_50002847) (Php 120)
   * not a lipstick person so i prefer lip gloss which transfers less and makes my lips less dry. i like how this moisturizes my lips while giving it a nice color. baka real nga ung sinasabi nila universal shade to hehehe

hope this helps!

For context kakabili ko lang nito last 11.11 sa tiktok live nila vs my peripera water bare tint na nabili ko last June 2024. 2 weeks of using it nanoticed ko na agad na bumabaho sya, amoy panis (unlike my peripera na same scent and color padin from the moment I opened it, take note no color separation din. I wanted to support local lalo na’t madaming magagandang local brands and products din talaga but never again happy skin, I have sensitive skin and lips since nagkaka-eczema ako even sa lips.

1fbw5d7,"Make up products that I use daily 💗 These are the make up products that I use routinely, either for work or for going out on weekends. I personally prefer make up looks na clean and fresh lang although I use many products 🤣

🎀Skintint: Issy Active Skin Tint (Beech)
Very light lang sa skin, makes my complexion even. I read a lot of reviews saying na humuhulas but as a dry skin girlie okay naman sya sakin and hindi sya patchy.

🎀Concealer: Nars Soft Matte Pot Concealer (2.5 Crème Brulée)
I use this for my under eyes and for spot-concealing dark spots/pimple marks. Perfect for spot-concealing but patchy sa under eyes if you have dry skin or if hindi na-set ng maayos.

🎀Setting Powder: Laura Mercier Ultra-Blur Loose Setting Powder (Translucent)
Very good for setting, make up stays all day! I usually just set my under eyes, sides of the nose, forehead, chin and jawline. I leave out the cheeks kasi gusto ko glowy pa rin sya.

🎀Cream Blush: Rare Beauty Melting Blush (Nearly Berry)
Very nice colour, mukhang natural blush kapag naiinitan ka. I've been looking for this blush colour for quite a while kasi I want a ""cherry-coloured"" cream blush. Pigmented din sya.

🎀Powder Blush & Bronzer: Teviant Deity Dust (Main Role) or Nars Blush/Bronzer Duo (Orgasm & Laguna)
I use these two palettes interchangeably. The teviant one I use for a very natural looking bronzer with pak na blush, the bronzer is PERFECT for nose contour as well, and the highlighter very subtle but ganda ng effect sa nose and cheek bones. The nars one I use naman if I want a very fresh-looking blush lang, or the bronzer for snatched cheek bones and jaw since more like pang contour yung shade nya on my skintone.

🎀Brows: Benefit Precisely My Brow and Gimme Brow+ Gel (both in no. 3)
I have naturally thick brows so I just use the pencil for the sparse area of my brows, it has a spooly as well on the other end. The brow gel I use to make my brows look groomed and to give them a bit of lighter colour since I have balayaged hair. Both products are budge-proof and smudge-proof so they stay all day regardless of the weather, mapawisan man or umulan.

🎀Mascara: Heroine Make Volume Up Waterproof Mascara
This is my holy grail!!! Grabe natry ko na mag breakdown while wearing this and hindi talaga sya kumalat or naalis 🤣 

🎀Lips: 
Clinique Almost Lipstick (Black Honey)- I use this as lip prep and lip balm throughout the day. Very nice pigment and keeps my lips moisturised.
Chuchu Beauty Lip Liner (Baked Nude)- Creamy that's why it's very easy and smooth to line my lips. Long lasting din.
Tom Ford Matte Lip Colour (100 100)- Perfect nude shade for me! Not too brown and not too pink. The texture is not very matte, it's more of like velvet matte, which I like. Not drying and it feels light sa lips. Longevity is just like any other lipstick and nag iiwan din ng tint once na wipe out. 

🎀Setting Spray: Charlotte Tilbury Airbrush Flawless
I swear by this one! Make up stay all day, and after spraying mas gumaganda appearance nung make up. Face looks dewy and glowy after. Not sticky or matapang sa feeling and mabango, so okay na okay for me.

🎀Finishing Powder: Charlotte Tilbury Airbrush Flawless Filter (2 Medium)
I apply this after setting my face and if I need touch ups during the day, which I don't usually need to do since I have dry skin and hindi naman ako oily. As other reviews say, para talagang naka filter ka after mo 'to iapply, living up to its name.

inspired by [this very informative post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeupAddiction/comments/2r4rfs/eyelash_curlers_in_numbers_measuring_their/) and my beloved watsons curler breaking down, i tried a bunch of eyelash curlers that are more locally accessible and measured them all. :))

\--------------------------------------------------

**HOW TO USE THIS TABLE:**

* the curlers are listed from the curviest to the flattest (the bigger the radius, the flatter the curve).

* if you don't want to do the math, the illustrations of the curlers' arcs might help

* BUT if you wanna get ✨mathematical✨, you can compute for the curvature of your eyes using [this tutorial](https://imgur.com/a/measuring-eye-curvature-JZCwU?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAR0FbierTuK5lbFpCuJDtvI2WQB9kvwHqw_K00t0UhfKq2LFjXggsmEODak_aem_9Cu6PqD0KTMXhqcujUN7oQ).

* after following the tutorial, plug in the values you got into [this website](https://www.handymath.com/cgi-bin/arc18mm2.cgi?submit=Back+to+Calculator&numnum=1&rad1&arc1&wid1=27&hei1=6.5&apo1&tet1&are1&dc3=selected&rr5=selected&aa5=selected&ww5=selected&hh5=selected&pp5=selected&tt1=selected&ee5=selected&fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAR1equ45qp5V5Ceter7BDqbL3W26tRPZG8Y4zLvEJEztUPxfCHNFPAJFmNA_aem_ZYjujmTkqaQdwaOgqmtLoQ) to get the radius. use millimeters (mm) and 2 decimal places.

* after getting your eye's measurements, compare it with the values in the table to find the curler with the closest measurements. for more product options, check out [the OG post ](https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeupAddiction/comments/2r4rfs/eyelash_curlers_in_numbers_measuring_their/)that inspired this. \[NOTE: take the values in the OG table with a grain of salt bc i'm not sure if they're all accurate. for instance, i distinctly remember the Shu Uemura curler being curvier than the Shiseido 213 but for some reason, it's listed lower in the table.\]

\--------------------------------------------------

**NOTES & OBSERVATIONS:**

* while the radius of arc gives you an idea of how curvy/flat the clamp is, you don't have to get a curler na may exact same radius as your eyes. in my experience, i could get away with using a curler with a radius that's around 1mm shorter, BUT the width must match or slightly exceed the eye width so that it doesn't pinch.

* if you already have the Glamfix curler, you don't need the Paulash curler because they’re *almost* exactly the same. ang pagkakaiba nila: sa Paulash, slightly curvier yung arc nung clamp from the front view (the way it curves along your lash line) so it would probably be better for rounder eyes. also, Glamfix actually feels sturdier and has more weight to it (which may be a pro or con for you depending on your preference).

* an eyelash curler that fits your eyes really does make a difference. aside from measuring the curlers, i tried them all and noticed that the ones that weren't wide enough or were too curved either pinched my eyelids, couldn't be angled properly to reach corner lashes, or gave my lashes a wonky or L-shaped curl. while using curlers that fit are so much easier and faster to use and were easy to angle around the eyes to reach the corners.

1hu3l0g,"Studio Suyen Review (dry hair cutting) ...My Quest for Shiny Charlotte York-Level Hair Goals

Hey Reddit! I’m here to share my experience with Studio Suyen in BGC. Since last year, I’ve been on a mission to achieve the shiniest, most polished hair — think Charlotte York from Sex and the City. I know it’s a TV show, but hey, a girl can dream!

Let’s talk about my hair:
I have thin, wavy, medium-density hair that frizzes at the slightest whiff of humidity. My bangs? They curl up the moment I step outside (unless I use one of those Japanese bangs mascaras).

For about a year now, I’ve been using my Dyson Airwrap, and I’ve perfected my routine with hair products. But I’ve been searching for that one hair studio I can trust for the long haul.

Enter Studio Suyen. What sets them apart?

They specialize in dry hair cutting, meaning they cut your hair based on how it looks in its natural state. No more surprises when your styled hair looks different once washed. This is a game-changer, especially for someone like me who deals with frizz and maintains bangs.

I booked an appointment (note: they only take 3-4 clients at a time...and i'm basing these on the chairs at the studio) and headed to their studio, conveniently located beside Studio Ceremonie in BGC.

My Experience: I opted for a dry haircut and their Activated Gloss Treatment because, again, shiny hair is the dream! The gloss is meant to give your hair that healthy, reflective finish — chef’s kiss.

In terms of ambiance, I love how quiet the space is. It feels like you're in a spa and I'm definitely all for it.

In terms of service, they were all polite and they've been very helpful with my hair goal Q&As. I forgot to mention that prior to the actual hair cutting, they will be doing a scalp scan to check the health of your scalp and post-haircut they will be airdropping you tips on how to maintain the fresh haircut look. 

It’s now Day 3 since my haircut, and I’m thrilled! My ends feel healthier, and for once, my just-woke-up hair doesn’t look like a bird’s nest. 

For someone with wavy, frizz-prone hair, that’s a big deal. I have yet to update this review 1-month after my treatment and hair cut to see how well my hair holds up.

The Caveat

This is a luxury hair studio, so expect premium prices. A dry haircut starts at ₱4,500, and if Suyen herself does your hair, it’s ₱8,000. The Activated Gloss Treatment costs ₱4,000.

Are there more affordable alternatives? Sure! Ulo Studio in San Juan offers dry cuts at a lower price point. But honestly, I’m sticking with Studio Suyen because I love the results already.

If you’re on the fence about trying a dry haircut or gloss treatment at Studio Suyen (or anywhere else), I hope this review helps you decide!

Would I recommend it? Yes, if you have the budget for it! 

Is this a must? Not at all. Like I've mentioned there are other studios offering dry hair cutting at a friendlier price range. Or you can even request your current salon to cut or trim your hair before they shampoo you.

As for me, I’ve found my go-to hair studio, and I couldn’t be happier. ✨

1gkwc0b,"Review of Anne Clutz brushes, a year after purchase I can’t say enough good things about the Anne Clutz Dual-Ended Travel Makeup Brushes! I’m genuinely impressed by the durability and performance of these brushes. I purchased them during the 8.8 sale in 2023, and after months of consistent use (I even carry them with me to apply makeup at the office), they still look and perform like new! I’ve tried other brands like OVW and Marj x Happy Skin, but I keep coming back to these for a reason.

First of all, the quality is outstanding. I’ve washed these brushes multiple times, and they haven’t shed much or become rough at all. The bristles are still intact, which is amazing considering how often I use and clean them. For a travel-friendly, dual-ended set, this level of durability is beyond impressive.

The blending is also flawless! Cream and liquid products apply seamlessly with these brushes—everything looks so well-blended and natural. The design is thoughtful, with denser brushes for precise, fuller coverage and softer, fluffier ends for a diffused, lighter look. It’s perfect for creating a versatile finish that works with any product texture.

And the price? It’s unbeatable. I got this set for only ₱600, which is an absolute steal considering the quality and functionality. Truly, it’s an amazing value for money. My only minor issue is with the concealer brush, which also doubles as an eyeshadow brush. I prefer having a dedicated concealer brush, so I ended up purchasing a separate one along with a thinner angled brush for precision. But even with that small tweak, this set has been phenomenal.

My cousin also noticed how similar these are to her Makeup by Mario brushes, she tried mine and said they could be a decent dupe.

1gjcvfy,"Quick blush review Currently loving K and C Beauty blushes, I’m really not the biggest fan of pigmented blushes, I love a natural type of flush on my cheeks, some may call it watercolor type of blush and all of these products work really well for girlies who have blush blindness cause you can’t “over”blush using these😆

Apieu and Hince - both remind me of Mac Glow Play, gives a really nice flush, so easy to blend, Hince especially gives that watercolor type of blush, very demure ganun. Manika! 

Clinique and Nature Republic - NR I think is a dupe for Clinique, NR is just a tad bit shinier parang may highlight ka na rin if you use it. For Clinique it’s really that nice natural flush to the cheeks parang ang healthy looking.

Nuse (Mousse version) - is sooo sooo good, I love it, another watercolor blush. It’s also healthy looking, ang dali iblend and it lasts long ha, like kinaya ang humid weather ng Bali. Not the friendliest bottle to travel with pero kebs kasi ang ganda talaga ng effect, nakaka brighten ng face. 

Fwee - hindi lang talaga travel friendly yung container, but it’s a multi use product that looks great on the eyes/cheeks/lips, it’s has a soft matter finish, nothing heavy on the face. But you might want to finish it with a layer of powder blush or highlighter on top if you love a glowy blush. 

Joocyee (New Cream and Multi Purpose Stick) - these are the perfect travel products you can bring anywhere. Joocyee I think, is kind of known for it’s form filming tech so it lasts really long, I especially love the multi purpose stick kasi nagllast talaga and it’s another one that gives off the watercolor blush lewk.

The lash extension trend made me forget about how good this mascara was. Naobsessed kasi ako with extensions, I liked that I don't have to put any effort to look put together, di na nakakapagod, especially for someone with straight, downturned Asian lashes with little to NO volume, mascara application to me always felt like a chore.

Anyway, while decluttering, I stumbled upon one of my old and probably expired 😭 heroine make mascara and decided to try it again and naalala ko how it got me through a really bad breakup noon na even after hours of crying, ni isang smudge wala, yang pilik ko nakatayo pa rin. 

For reference: My lashes after crying cause nanood akong Miracle in cell no 7 LOL. Nanood talaga ako non para maiyak ako for this review  mhaahahahah

Last I checked, 795 per tube price nya and if you use it everyday for 6 months, 4.40 pesos lang sya per use. SOBRANG SULIT. Itataya ko buhay ko dito. PROMISE

Product: Kiss Me Heroine Make Long & Curl Mascara Advanced Film/Extra Waterproof

Also: There's not much of a difference between the two kasi I get them both and they are both very reliable for me, pero if you're buying the extra waterproof, buy their remover also para less hassle kasi kahit ata maglupasay ka di sya matatanggal easily.

1jkdzmh,"A year with Dyson Airwrap I bought a refurbished Dyson Air. US-based ako^. Sa awa ng Diyos gumagana pa din! I heard Dyson’s customer/after sales service is 💩 

I was struggling to use it because I have short hair a year ago and clueless.

I’m still testing products out and watching a bunch of reels on tips and tricks for using the Airwrap.

Things I did:

1. I’m not doing hair masks and hair conditioners as often. I have Kerastase Hair Mask Nutritive and Biolage Matrix HydraSource Conditioner. Pansin ko bumigat lang lalo buhok ko, hirap tumagal yung curls.

2. Shampoos, I change it up, and I’m quite inconsistent because I’m using a medicated shampoo: ketonazole shampoo (I have bad dandruff and it works), Head and Shoulders, and Biolage Matrix HydraSource Shampoo.

3. Followed a lot of hair content creators but the two main ones are: lucymaedrewek (Aha moment for me with her hair sectioning tips and rollers) and abigaillinnn (asian hair type). I’m still trying to find a content creator who’ll do a timelapse with their curls. I try to follow a lot of asian hair type na mga content creator. 

4. Additional products: Redken Root Lifter, JVN Milk Blowout Cream (now this one made my hair soft to touch, tipong ph shampoo commercial “walang sabit”), Kerastase Elixir Hair Oil (after rollers my hair gets frizzy this fixes it plus extra shine), Joico Power Setting Spray (I don’t like the crunchy feeling, but it also made my curls last), Kerastase Heat Protectant Genesis. 

5. Products I’m 50:50: Kerastase Overnight Hair Serum, and It’s a 10 hair cream. I posted it about a month or two months ago, silk bonnet, struggling to use kasi it keeps falling off and nawawala yung volume, sleepy ties naman it gets loose during the night, the satin pillow case is meh but I’m not going to use a cotton pillow case mas lala yung frizz. 

6. I bought the other Dyson extension blade concentrator, mas mabilis yung drying. The bigger round brush, I couldn’t use it sobrang init I feel like mg hair is going to get fried. 

7. Drying, about 70-80% dry is perfect for me. Kung sobrang tuyo hindi kakapit and it’s not going to last. 

8. I use hair rollers after then hair spray it. After I’ve put all the rollers I hairspray it aggressively and leave it for 30 mins. 
 

Pondered tots, I was talking to a friend who recently bought an airwrap and she was disappointed it didn’t last long (turns out she wasn’t using any products). A year ago she told me to just buy the shark one (cheaper) eh ako well you do you and  I do me, my money is set to buy dyson. I was surprised she bought and buy the airwrap. 

- It’s not a perm (it’s not going to kast for months HAHA), and set a realistic expectation on your hair. I hope I saved one of those before and after performer/artists hair when they do concerts, talagang mejo nawawala yung kulot nila. Kaya sana may influencer na mag post about how long their curl last. Asian hair pa so resistant 🙃

- some girls, hair wash day is every 4-5 days, ako I kennat, two days are enough or else I’ll get a headache. And its okay if we don’t get to day 4/5. Everybody is different and living in different climates. Kung nasa Pinas ako feel ko everyday ako magsha-shampoo.

- just enjoy the process, I always look forward to hair day, it’s like a pamper/self care day. 

I’ve been loving it so far. At first I was having second thoughts. Akala ko matatambak lang sa cabinet pero nope, I’ve been using it consistently.

My personal experience:

Vaseline lip care rosy lips - may fragrance, may shine sa lips. Ang bilis lumambot ng lips pag eto ginagamit ko. Currently assigned sa baba ng bahay katabi ng makeup, ginagamit ko whenever nagbubura ng ibang lip product.

ChapStick - may fragrance (matapang), may konting shine sa lips. og favorite lipbalm ko, naka tatlong tubes na ko neto kahit ang dami kong lipbalm. eto yung fave ko iapply before liptint dati, ubos na tong nasa pic talaga haha

Human Heart Nature Sunflower Lip Miracle - may fragrance (bet ko), may shine (para kang naglipgloss). Okay naman siya kaso nahihirapan ako tansyahin yung pagsqueeze ng tube since liquidy tong lip oil ganern. Assigned sa loob ng makeup bag, middle child, wala sa rotation,  ginagamit lang pag sobrang dry at nagbabalat na lips ko

Watsons CeraMide Lip Cream - may fragrance, may shine. Konti na lang since gamit na gamit ko siya dati after ko tanggalin ibang lip product ko, ang bilis rin makalambot ng lips.

Vaseline Emily In Paris Nude Noveau - may tint, may fragrance (bet ko rin hehe), may konting shine. medyo mabagal ang glide sa lips. 9.9 purchase ko (dahil sa series and dahil cute hehe) and natuwa ako kasi ang ganda ng shade niya! Madalas kasi pink or red tint ng mga lipbalm sa drugstores. Nakakasoft rin ng lips ko. Di ko pa alam kung saan ang magiging designated location niya sa bahay haha

Watsons Baby Tint Glow Coral Rose - may tint, may fragrance (matapang), may shine. mabilis ang glide sa lips. Currently assigned sa kwarto katabi ng skin care products, para magamit ko lagi (di ko kasi favorite dahil sa fragrance)

Fresh Beauty Tinted Jelly Lipbalm Strawberry - may tint, may fragrance, may shine. average glide speed. Assigned sa kama para magamit lagi, mejo hinayang since mukhang mas mabebet ko yung wild berries shade.

Hello Glow Lipbalm - may fragrance (mild), may konting shine. medyo mabagal iglide sa lips. Current favorite na gamitin before magliptint and nakaassign sa baba ng bahay katabi ng makeup.

Naturals by Watsons Prestige Rose - may tint, may fragrance (ang bangooo), may konting shine. mabilis ang glide sa lips. Former favorite bago madethrone ni Hello Glow hahaha. Nakaassign rin sa baba ng bahay katabi ng makeup, I use this if wala akong ibang lip product na ilalagay other than lipbalm

Maybelline Baby Lips Color Pink Lolita - may tint, may fragrance, pang popstar ang shine hahaha. Binili ko noong unang nauso tong baby lips lipbalm, then paubos na't lahat, naging biktima pa ng out of sight, out of mind 😆 Assigned siya ngayon sa baba ng bahay katabi rin ng makeup, ginagamit kong pantanggal ng ibang lip products.

Dad's Honey Beeswax Lipbalm - may fragrance (ang bango rin!!), almost no shine! average glide speed. Currently assigned sa bulsa ng bag ko, bought noong nagbakasyon ako sa Cebu. Grabe, ilang months rin yata na puro eto yung gamit ko, kahit magliptint ako or hindi. Nakahanap rin ako ng afforadable-moisturizing-not-too-shiny-not-too-soft in one kinemer ko and paubos na siya and eto talaga bibili ulit ako pag naubos ko aaa bongga/10 sha for mi

Carmex Lipbalm - may fragrance, may konting shine. average glide speed. ANG LAMIG SA LIPS. Malambot yung balm niya compared sa ibang nandito sa list (or dahil lang yata naiwan kong nakatapat sa laptop kaya softer na siya than usual?)

1e2z0ac,"Spent 7800 for GRWM products Please don't come after me for buying one brand lang, I'm still a newbie🫣

I just want to share this WIN for me. 
I have been interested in make up since HS because of Summer Tadlock  YT (Millennial tita here). 15 years old me has been dreaming of a full set of make up brush and make up kit but we're too broke to afford it so hanggang nood lang ako.  Then got pregnant at 19 so I need to work my ass off para mabuhay baby ko but I still watch my favorite beauty vloggers. 

Then came 2024, I have to take a graduation picture for TOR don't really trust the free make up na included sa package. So I decided to na bumili nalang and do it on my own after watching gazillion make up tutorial videos.

So asa SM north ako ng GRWM kiosk, I was planning to buy skin tint lang sana, contour stick, blush and concealer but the consultant at their kiosk is so helpful so I ended up buying everything 😅 then when I ask the total sabi around 7k na medyo na pause ako and check my account and afford naman, a bit hesistant for a sec but I realised I have been working hard for my son and my family and I have been wanting this since 15 so I think I deserve it?? 

Anyway I went for it and boy was I happy! Inner child healed indeed. Ang sarap pala sa feeling, if I can travel back in time and tell my 15 year old me that we will buy 7k worth of make up in one receipt, she would be flabbergasted. 

I know to some 7k is still cheap but for me it's enough and I'm just so proud na ang layo ko na pala kasi ni hindi ako naghinayang man lang sa purchase ko.

Anyway share ko lang💖",https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1e2z0ac,450,59,Hauls,grwm,local,"concealer, blush, contour, skin tint, brush",,2024-07-14,Positive
1d4w2vx,"things i've learned when i was a beginner in makeup i've been seeing many people wanting to learn makeup lately, so i'd like to share some lessons and realizations i had when i first started off makeup :]

**figure out what makeup style you want to achieve**

knowing what aesthetic or style you want to go for really helps in curating tutorials/products to achieve that desired look. 

I personally wanted to go for a douyin/korean inspired makeup look so most of the tutorials and looks I followed and got inspiration from were MUAs who specialized in said makeup styles.

After curating tutorials, try to figure out what do these MUAs do in common. This will help you figure out the general style of the makeup look you want to achieve so that you can apply it and adjust it based on your face shape and features.

**figure out the focal point/s in your face**

after knowing what makeup look you want, filter out the content or tutorials you need by figuring out what parts of your face do you want your makeup to stand out in. Try to target a specific area in your face (eyes, cheeks, lips, etc.), and practice in that part and slowly adjust how you do your makeup in other parts of your face based on your focal points. This tip made learning less overwhelming, and it also made sure my makeup on diff. areas in my face are not clashing at all.

For me, I wanted my eyes and my lips to stand out, so I focused on practicing in those parts of my face first, and the tutorials I watched were geared towards creating the perfect eyeshadow/lippie look.

**know your skin type**

important din malaman ano ang skin type so that you can avoid buying makeup products na hindi hiyang ng face mo. Aside from that, the very first step of makeup is to prepare your skin which means na there is still skincare involved in makeup. Nakakabawas ito sa chances na magpill or humulas ang iyong base because this ensures that your makeup will sit right on your face throughout the day hehe

**don't be afraid to start with few products**

I started off with a tinted sunscreen, powder, a quad eyeshadow, and one liptint only. In my opinion, you don’t really have to buy many products when you start off makeup because you’ll eventually change your first products for even better ones when you finally get the hang of it.

these are the basic products you might want to invest in first:

- base (skintint, foundation, or cushion)
- setting powder
- blush and eyeshadow (both are optional, you can buy both as two separate products or just one of them but i also know there are multi purpose pans that alr exist in the market if you want to save and still get both)
- lip product

also don’t be afraid to start with drugstore makeup first! start off with affordable makeup kasi like i said, you’ll switch them for better ones in the long run. just make sure you buy ones that are fda approved. go for dupes but avoid ripoffs! (an example of this is herorange, a makeup brand in the orange app that  actually makes ripoffs of famous c-beauty brands like flortte, hezhuang, etc.)

**forget about the cool tone/warm tone thing for now**

this might sound controversial, but I believe that being overly conscious of whether you are cool toned or warm toned really stops you from fully learning makeup as a beginner. As a beginner, you are in the experimental stage of your makeup journey, and I think labelling yourself as only either cool or warm toned would really limit your perspective because I feel like it is a generalized label for undertones.

Instead, try to figure out what colors you think washes out your features and what sits right on your face, and you’ll eventually find yourself gearing towards a more specific tone that you are most comfortable in.

In short, don’t worry about this too much for now and wag din maoverwhelm sa dami ng tiktok videos about this! kasi honestly, mahirap talaga intindihin ang undertones sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t. ang mahalaga is comfortable ka and you feel pretty sa makeup mo!

napahaba ang post 😭 but yeah ang bottomline is learning process ang makeup, and the best part of it is experimenting until you find your own style! feel free to add more lessons learned below lets help our girlies out <33",https://www.reddit.com/r/beautytalkph/comments/1d4w2vx/things_ive_learned_when_i_was_a_beginner_in_makeup/,447,45,Discussion,belo,local,"foundation, powder, blush, eyeshadow, lash, makeup",tiktok,2024-05-31,Neutral
1h6biy1,"Issy SM North sales lady  I went to SM north and I remembered my friend told me na may pop up store ang Issy doon.

When I saw it, I was excited to try their Active Foundation. 

May customer na nagswswatch ng same product and the two sales lady were assisting her, wala kasi gaanong lighting so finaflashlight-an pa nila ng phone si ate customer.

Since kakarating ko lang, I just put some foundation sa kamay ko and then looked at it in the mirror not too far away from them.

Eventually umalis na rin yung naunang customer saken, and I was looking at the shades. 

I didn’t know the OF, NF, and YF since it’s my first time sana trying their product. 

Yung isa bumalik na sa station nya and isa nalang natira dun sa foundation section, inask ko si ate about it but she didn’t even bother to answer properly. Tinanong ko kung ano difference ng tatlo, dalawa lang snabi niya. I didn’t even know na may Olive na since the last time I bought foundation, wala pang foundation for olive skin tone, and that shades na nagstart sa OF ay foundation for olive skin tone.

I even asked a question which is answerable by yes or no (I forgot the question tho), tinaasan lang ako ng kilay, hindi ko pa malalaman kung anong sagot nya if di ko pa siya tinignan since I was busy looking at the products. 

I actually prefer it if di ako ginugulo ng sales lady, but to ask questions and not have the proper answers to it is kind of frustrating. Also the fact na inaassist naman nila yung customer before me? 

Anw di na ako bumili, when I got home, nakita ko na meron palang sampler yung foundation sa shopee which is good so I can try it first.

Just a reminder na this is a customer facing job so whether you like it or not, need niyo makipag interact sa customers nyo.

1lsrurq,"Mid-year empties Can’t believe I’ve finished 32 products in 5 months! (my January empties is in another post). Generally happy with my current relationship with makeup, skincare, perfume, and bodycare. I no longer feel the urge to buy something new compared to 2022-2023 where I’ve accumulated tons of new makeup and perfume that I felt disgusted with myself, which prompted my project pan in mid-2023.

Aside from repurchasing products that I’ve finished, the only unnecessary makeup I bought so far was Violette FR bisou balm — it has been on my wish list since last year.

1hy39fv,"our local makeup brands have limited innovation. no one stands out.  what do they all have in common? lip liners? lip tints? cream blush? gel liners? i feel like a lot of the brands are so afraid of exploring other products. puro na lang skin tint or whatnot. don’t get me wrong, I LOVE MY LOCAL MAKEUP FINDS (i’m talking to u, absidy, vice, lucky, issy!!! 🩷) but y’all lack innovation! you guys basically all sell the same thing in different packaging :// at least that’s how it feels like. 

we need HUMIDITY-RESISTANT base products. something that us filipinas would actually like in this tropical setting. speaking of setting and humidity, a really good setting spray or a grip primer???? or for the creative girlies, a massive colorful palette like the ones from morphe or painted by james charles. tho it’s convenient, im tired of seeing the same pocket sized eyeshadows in the same shade range. 

it feels as if our local makeup brands are just trying to compete with each other by copying one another. no one tries to tap into specialized niches. as someone who loves makeup a lot and started doing cut creases as an 11 y/o, pls pls pls stop copying each other. 

there are also people who prefer bold, unconventional, or niche makeup styles. many of them are left with limited options locally and probably have to resort to cheap, unreliable, and unregulated products from an online shop

the market  saturation makes it feel like there are no truly groundbreaking or distinctive products being introduced per brand and it’s kinda sad 😔 

i’m saying this again, I LOVE MY LOCAL MAKEUP BRANDS. di ako basher. it’s just my observation as a consumer. :^ 

—

EDIT: here are my takes from the replies bc a lot of people seem to misinterpret what i said/rubbed them the wrong way (lol parang may keyboard warrior yung brands dito). it’s understandable that companies want to play it safe and cater to their largest customer base, especially since it’s easier to sell products that have a proven track record. but what ends up happening is that everything starts feeling a bit too familiar, which stifles growth in terms of creativity and product diversity. 

for the affordability, i think it boils down if the company actually wants to cut-costs or milk their consumers’ money. it is a business too, after all. 

>> if every brand keeps launching the same basic products, it creates a market where consumers get bored, and that stunts both brand growth and the overall makeup community in the country. 

- there's definitely room to cater to the experimental or niche crowd. also, di naman ‘to required, it was just a suggestion and it could literally be anything. they’re smaller in number but they could help push the growing industry = mainstream consumers will eventually want to try

we have to remember a lot of these local PH makeup brands aren't small businesses anymore—they've got the resources to invest in r&d if they really wanted to, but they just don't seem to prioritize it. i get that it’s still a relatively new market, and i never said they should be groundbreaking agad, but the fact is, they have the potential to push things forward and they're not. 

instead, we're stuck with the same few products recycled across multiple brands. it was never about rushing innovation, it's about refining what’s already there and introducing new ideas at a steady pace. at the end of the day, a little more risk could lead to products that stand out and actually grow the industry. i’m only saying this bc i have a lot of trust in our own products and i want to believe they’re able to one day be on par with the bigger brands internationally. 

>> innovation doesn’t always have to mean a huge price hike. if a local brand could somehow offer a unique, affordable version of something that truly works for the local climate, it could still carve out a niche. think about how fil consumers are willing to splurge on local brands if they feel like the quality, ingredients, or performance are worth it.

1k6knod,"Skin Update! How I am healing my fungal acne Original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/beautytalkph/comments/1jsnot5/sharing_is_caring_wanted_to_share_how_i_am/)

Just wanted to do a quick update on my skin as the original post garnered so many views and comments and I thought people would be interested on an update.

Here's my skin less than a month after (27 days to be exact). Acne has almost completely disappeared and reddening of the skin is almost gone. Wala na also itchy areas. I do have some texture issues I need to solve next but I am just so grateful and happy that my skin is doing so much better. 

A few changes I made after reading the comments (thank you for them! This is why I love Reddit): 

\- Dr. Wong's Sulfur Soap with Aloe Moisturizer (white packaging) - from 2-3 minutes, I just use this to cleanse my face for less than a minute na in the morning and evening. I just use the soap bubbles and not the soap directly. 

\- Dr. Sensitive Niacinamide + Salicylic Acid - as my daily moisturizer in the evening only. Used to do both AM & PM but considered to do only in the PM and what a game changer. No more itching in the AM (used to itch after layering this with my sunscreen). Will def repurchase!

\- Dr. Sensitive Sunscreen (not the tinted one!) - still as my sunscreen. This has Niacinamide so using this as my 2 in 1 moisturizer and sunscreen and so far so good! Will repurchase!

\- Still using as my shampoo and conditioner the 2 in 1 Selsun Blue Shampoo-Conditioner. I found it to be a bit drying so I only use a little bit on my roots. 

Am working on slowly incorporating my old skincare that worked for me (i.e Cerave moisturizer in the PM, Cosrx AHA/BHA and HN Serum in the AM) that can hopefully help with the texture and redness.

1ezkygy,"skincare i would never forget to bring on travel ! Keeping up with the theme of the previous title of my “makeup i actually bring to travel” post here is the skincare that I would never forget to bring on travel except it’s just my whole skincare routine HAHAHA. Let me break it down:  
  
[Detailed reviews & proof of purchases in pic]  
Skin type: dry with flakiness around nose and mouth; prone to hormonal acne (i have pcos) and fungal acne (i have sensitivity to certain ingredients)

Morning routine:
Oxecure facial wash - i only wash quickly around my face to keep it clean from whatever dirt got on it while i was sleeping, being careful i don’t strip my face too dry in the morning. 
  
Cezanne high moist - it’s in a laneige bottle cuz it’s easier to spray 😅 (i used to love the laneige and purchased it twice pero di pala sila bds safe ><) i spray my whole face after facial wash to keep moisture on my face.   
  
mixsoon bifida toner pads - i use one half of the pad 30 secs on each cheek then wipe down my whole face. 

Melano cc vit c serum - i dot my cheeks, nose, chin, and forehead with a drop of the serum (a tiny droplet not usual one dropper kind) and spread. 
  
Carecera ap emulsion moisturizer - I moisturize my face and let it sink in for 1-2 minutes before i apply sunblock. 
  
Sunbears sunblock - i apply this twice to make sure i get the recommended amount cuz the formula is really runny so i can’t do the usual two finger method ><  
  
Night routine:  
Hado labo cleansing oil - i do 1 pump for daily makeup and 2 pumps if i have heavier makeup on. 
  
Oxecure facial wash - for double cleansing. 
  
Cezanne high moist - to lock in moisture. 
  
Skinoren azelaic acid - i only use this every MWFSun and apply a peasize amount nothing more too avoid irritation. 
  
Iope milk - i apply this cuz my skin needs extra moisture and layer it before moisturizer so i don’t have to do a thick layer. 
  
Illiyoon moisturizer - this is what i use to seal the moisture as a last step. This is super paubos na tho so i’ll be using the carecera one once i squeezed the whole life out of it 😅. 
  
I try to keep my skincare as simple as possible cuz i found that there are a lot of ingredients that my skin doesn’t like [i.e tea tree, aloe vera, hyalauronic acid in high concentrations (hated the hado labo lotions), niacinamide (i used to love this but i now get irritated if it’s in high dosages)] so I really read the ingredients list and make sure the products are good for me. I also research a lot!! Before i buy something I go through so many reviews and posts to make sure I’m gonna like it cuz nothing hurts more than spending on something you regret aND ruined your skin. Also the products I use are very affordable most of them are less than ₱500 and if they’re ₱500+ they are worth it (mixsoon toner pads technically have 240 pads for ₱990 which is ₱4 per pad unlike mediheal which has 100 pads for ₱890 making it ₱8.9 per pad (i like this toner pad too tho)). 
  
I’ve also used items throughout the years i didn’t like, did nothing for me, and even ruined my skin (lmk if ya’ll want me to talk more about them!) i also have some faves that are out of my rotation cuz even if i see a product i wanna try i won’t buy it till the one i currently have is running out. So these products on this post are a fruit of years of extensive trial and error that makes me finally feel confident in my skin (i still have a few break skin acne scars tho but that’s cuz i didn’t listen to my dad and picked on my pimples 😭). Also a tip, i try to refill my skincare/try new skincare every 11.11 or 6.6 cuz most of my skincare lasts me 6 months 🤩",https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ezkygy,437,116,Review,"laneige, cezanne","international, international","moisturizer, makeup",,2024-08-23,Neutral
1ircpxs,"skin tints I have oily, acne-prone skin with a few dry patches and a neutral-cool undertone. 

Issy & Co (bisque) — my first skin tint ever! shade match is nice, and yung lapat niya sa face maganda din but one thing I hate about it is grabe ako mag oil up sakanya, kahit maset mo ng maayos or whatsoever. will prolly recommend this to someone na clear face kasi very sheer lang sya :)

Belo tinted sunscreen — maganda naman sya pero ang hapdi niya sa mata pag matagal mo nang suot. the coverage is also nice, nacocover niya red marks ko. Would not recommend this to dark skin tones kasi kahit may tone adapt technology siya parang pang fair-light skin tone lang talaga + mejo matagal bago ako mag oil up. 

Sola (light beige) — very runny and coverage is nice kahit onti lang ilagay mo, also covers up my red marks but what I hate about this is nagccling sya sa dry patches ko, kahit ang dami ko na nilalagay na moisturizer ganon pa din. maganda naman sya kasi kahit buong araw mo suot, it still looks nice, and ganda ng lapat niya. 

Colourette first base (bonbon) — nag break out ako:((( it's lightweight as they claim and hulas proof talaga sya kasi whole day ako nasa school and ok parin sya tho but yun lang nagkaroon ako ng tiny bumps sa face. so think twice if you want to buy this and di ko sya mare recommend sa acne prone skin kasi baka mag worsen acne niyo.

Vice Cosmetics Blurrfection (in fair) — very lightweight, coverage is medyo sheer yet buildable, but nagccling sa dry patches. hindi niya din masyado nacocover red marks ko, and hindi ako masyado nag oil up. mejo uncomfy na sya sa init kasi parang natutunaw siya:(

Happy skin (fair) — THIS ONE IS MY FAVE AMONG ALL! 🥰 very hydrating, nacocover red marks ko, doesn't cling to my dry patches, and is lightweight! as in ang ganda talaga. you might as well consider this if you're looking for a good skin tint!

1jmnmqy,"I was feeling insecure about my textured skin, but looking back at my old photos made me realize how far I’ve come. It’s not perfect, but I’m grateful for the progress. Here’s my current skincare routine, hope this helps Disclaimer: These products worked for me, but I’m not advertising anything—you have to find what works for you. I hope this helps in some way!

**📋 My Simple Routine**  
I've tried countless products, some didn’t work, some were effective but too expensive (with cheaper alternatives), and others were simply unnecessary. After a lot of trial and error, I built this routine with practicality, affordability, and effectiveness in mind.  
  
I now keep it simple: just two products in the morning and evening.

* **Morning (staying in):** Azelaic acid + Moisturizer
* **Morning (going out):** SPF
* **Night (T-Th-Sa):** Glycolic acid + Moisturizer
* **Night (M-W-F):** Adapalene + Moisturizer

**🏷️ Moisturizer**  
These are the moisturizers I’ve tried and loved. I only use one at a time, if my current one runs out, I either repurchase it or pick another from my favorites.  
*\* Sebo de Macho* is the most affordable option. My skin and wallet loved it so much that I used it for almost a year.

**🏷️ Spot Treatment**  
When my Neutrogena BP ran out, I tried Bioderm from Mercury Drug—just as effective but only ₱35!

**🏷️ Non-negotiabl**e  
*Azelaic acid & Adapalene*: Help prevent new acne.  
*Glycolic acid*: Helps with hyperpigmentation.

1d2d5e5,"[REVIEW] Issy Gelée okay, issy gelée tint has finally arrived and im gonna be showing swatches and comparing it to every glossy liptint I own

makulimlim today huhu sorry pero ayan window light with no edits. 

💭 Issy first impression
THE SHADE IS GORGEOUS. 
Packaging is chef’s kiss 😫
Guuurl props to issy for its good shade range it is really true to color based on their description and isnt red or pink of somesort (unlike that one certain brand jks). 

✷ **FEELS** Doesn’t feel sticky nor heavy at all ! honestly kindda moisturized my lips made it look juicy but I haven’t tried it with a crusty ass lip because i was wearing lipbalm the whole morning lol. 

✷ **SCENT** Smells like subtle chocolates but it isnt overpowering naman unless you really sniff it inside the bottle/wand lol. 

✷ **GLOSS** I kindda expected a little more regarding the gloss but meh it isnt glossy at all. 

✷ **STAIN/COLOR** Yep, it does oxidize a shade darker after 5 minutes. Now for the stain it left I have the shade k!nk which is on the lighter side mas lighter siya on my hand swatch but a tad brighter on my lips (maybe my lip color was a factor idk) also if you have the same undertone as I do which is Fair/Light Neutral the most gorg MLBB is K!NK 

so it is something that wow-ed me? Not really I just adored the shade range because true nga its puro pinks/reds on the local market and you can only find true nude/muted tints sa korean market one example  is rom&nd’s juicy lasting tint’s shade range. 

would I repurchase? probably another shade az a hoarder of lip products myself 😩  I can only speak for the shade k!nk on how it performed on me kindda curious with the dark shades. 

littler disclaimer idk how it performs when eating pa ah will update you guys more in first impression and ive been wearing it for two hours pa lang. 

closest formula (in the local market) kindda reminds me of chuchu beauty nga 😟 but chuchu is way more glossier. I already threw my chuchu kasi I hated it lol if someone has both pls pls compare them.  

anyway i think get this if you want a good everyday liptint that isnt that glossy, but moisturizing with so-so stain and wants a shade na muted/mlbb talaga. 

ps. reviewed my tints na way back here’s the link https://www.reddit.com/r/beautytalkph/s/QBG4zeHK5A

**SUMMARIZED**

✷ PIGMENT: issy gelée, peripera ink mood glowy tint, rom&nd glasting water tint, rom&nd juicy lasting tint and lucky beauty dewy lip stain

✷ STAIN: peripera ink mood glowy tint, peripera water blur tint, rom&nd glasting water tint

✷ SHEER: cezanne watery liptint and inga mood glowy tint

✷ OXIDIZATION: inga mood glowy tint, certain shades of rom&nd juicy lasting tint, and issy gelée tint

✷ GLOSS: rom&nd juicy lasting tint when applied correctly, rom&nd glasting water tint (really high shine), and peripera ink mood glowy tint

✷ WATERY: peripera water blur tint (true water tint talaga) 

✷ MOISTURIZING: peripera ink mood glowy tint and issy gelée

anyway thanks for reading! lmk if may questions kayo and may want ipacompare Didnt want to keep this too long lol. ",https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1d2d5e5,426,107,Review,"issy, lucky beauty, peripera, cezanne","local, local, international, international",lip stain,,2024-05-28,Neutral
1na3dzu,"Colourette Cosmetics (Rant) Literal na inorder mo versus yung dumating😤

I’ve never been this so angry and disappointed in a makeup/skincare brand in my whole life. Grabe si Colourette. Sinubok ng malala yung pasensya ko.

Here’s my story. Since naubos na setting spray ko recently, nag research ako about local brands and nag check ng reviews online about their products. Ilang araw kong ginawa to and nag ask pa ako sa mga kakilala ko kung kumusta experience nila sa mga local brands na gamit nila. After this whole freaking process, I finally decided and chose to purchase Super Base coz ang gaganda talaga ng reviews and I feel like it will really work well sa skin ko. As an oily girlie, I really do my research talaga kung ano yung pinaka feasible product na sasang ayon sa skin type ko. Sakto din na may pupuntahan akong wedding kaya super excited ako sa purchase na’to para masubok yung product kung tama ba talaga yung mga comments about it. Here’s the timeline:

Aug 14 - placed my order. Enough time ito and aabot naman sya before the wedding na pupuntahan ko on 23rd.
Aug 15 - Gulat and super happy ako kasi dumating agad agad yung order. But unfortunately, ang dumating na item sa akin is the Sun Base. 
Aug 16 - I reached out sa customer service to raised the concern. Nag request sila ng details, photos, etc. I provided it right away naman kasi hinahabol ko din na makarating yung order ko before the wedding.
Aug 17 - they replied acknowledging the details that I provided and rest assured daw na they will treat my concern with urgency.
Aug 18 - I told them na I hope to receive my order asap sana kasi again, gagamitin ko sya for a wedding.

On the same day, they replied naman na don’t worry they will send the correct item within 3 to 5 days and no need to return the wrong items. And nag request na wag akong mag request ng refund which hindi naman ako nag request ng refund kasi nag sabi sila na idedeliver naman and I trusted them naman. 

I replied and said thank you but kako I am nore than willing na ibalik yung wrong order kasi loss ng business yun. But they insist and I can keep it na daw.

Aug 22 - I followed up kasi kina-bukasan na yung wedding.

Aug 23 - they submitted the follow up daw and they’ll send an update and treat my concern with urgency. Lels.

Aug 25 - (see 3rd image) 

Aug 26 - they replied na due to technical issues daw things are taken longer than expected. Hindi nalang ako nag reply kasi hindi ko na din actually alam yung sasabihin ko. Ayaw kong magalit or ratratin customer service nila coz they don’t deserve to be treated like that naman.

Sep 4 - I messaged asking for an update. No response na sila. Lels.

Sep 5 - Wow! Finally! I received a parcel from them but habang kinakapa ko yung parcel, sabi ko bakit parang ang gaan and ang liit and nakakaloka kasi pag open ko, takip nung super base yung pina-dala nila.

I know some people will tell me bakit hindi nalang ako bumili ng iba pang back up. Well, not everyone naman have that privilege na mag back up purchase plus I’m a minimalist and ayokong nag dodoble doble yung mga items na meron ako. Kaya as much as possible, I trusted the brand and keep their word but gosh I did not expect na hahantong sa disappointment ito huhuhuhu.

May naka-experience ba ng same scenario? Need ko ng karamay kasi nakaka-lungkot and sobrang nakaka-disappoint talaga. I know it’s less than 1k but pinag hirapan ko yung money para maka-buy nung product na yun huhuhuhu.

1bmlk5v,"📣 new local product alert! another copycat/""dupe""? 👀🔍 Tinted lip oils/glossy balms in squeeze tubes have been having a viral moment in the int'l beauty space and it has finally trickled down to the local beauty market. I thought at first either Happy Skin, Issy, or BLK will be the first one to release a product like this in the PH considering their track record of copying bigger brands but Dr Sensitive surprised me with this new release. I think some other local brands will follow and release something like this and that clicky pen type of glossy lippies too, just like how they copied and released trendy products before like lip oils, liquid blushes, bright pink blushes, brow laminators, etc. 🤭 

What do we think of this new release? Do we love dupes and affordable alternatives? Has dupe culture gone too far these days by blatantly copy-pasting product ideas without any subtlety or differentiation? 🤔

1hta7nm,"Japan Beauty Haul Sharing my J-beauty haul from my recent Tokyo trip! If you're visiting Japan, here's a quick guide from someone who's tried and tested majority of the best and viral J-beauty products!

Note: got some from Don Quijote but as a tip, try purchasing majority of your beauty products from drugstores such as Matsumoto Kiyoshi and Sundrug. They offer 10% + 7% discounts if you purchase 10,000 yen above! 

Added a 🌸 emoji for my holy grails too! 

HAIR
1. &Honey hair oil - tried the classic Deep Moist Hir oil but found it a bit thick for my liking. I find the Melty pink variant lighter and smells better. Tip: best when applied on damp hair. 
2. &Honey Shampoo and Hair Treatment - A must buy if you want healthy and soft hair!
3. 🌸Fino Premium Touch Hair Mask - For someone who has bleached her hair many times, this is a life saver! Tried so many masks and this is by far the best! A must hoard!
4. Fino Premium Touch Hair Oil - This seems to be a new product from the brand Fino but heard so many good reviews (some claim this is better than &Honey)
5. Liese Hair Refresher - Makes your hair smell so good and fresh! PH only has limited plus expensive dry shampoos available.
6. Matomage Hair Stick - a viral product for smoothening out baby hairs.

FACE
1. 🌸Melano CC Vitamin C Premium Essence - Makes your dark spots disappear I swear!! I find the premium variant is more effective. My go-to vitamin C serum. This is the only product that faded the acne marks on my forehead.
2. Melano CC Vitamin C Lotion - Heard great reviews about this when partnered with the Vitamin C serum. 
3. Rohto Hada Labo Premium Hyaluronic Acid - Honestly haven't tried but heard good reviews about this one.
4. Sana eye cream - Say goodbye to dark and puffy eyes with this one! Comes with different variants but I gravitate to the classic one.
5. Keana Rice Mask - Japan viral rice mask for reducing clogged pores. Also got a pack for the bf!
6. Kose Clear Turn Better Than Sleep Face Mask - This mask claims to make you look like you've had 8hrs of sleep! Use this before applying make-up. Got two variants. Perfect for on-site working girlies.
7. Beauty of Joseon Relief Sun SPF - Haven't tried but heard good claims about this product and brand. Tip: If you're looking for a good sunscreen from Japan, I personally like Anessa & Biore too. 

BODY
1. Cow Brand Beauty Soap - Viral beauty soap that claims to moisturize and lighten skin.

MAKE-UP
1. 🌸DHC Cleansing Oil - tried so many cleansing oils from Japan (Softy, Biore) but this one makes your skin look fresh after! 
2. Bi-fiesta eye and lip make-up remover - doesn't sting your eyes!
3. 🌸Kissme Heroine Make Mascara - Can't leave Japan without this mascara. One of the best for Asian eyes.
4. 🌸Canmake Marshmallow Powder - My everyday powder. I hoard this in Japan! Makes your face look smooth and healthy. 
5. Wake Make Eyeshadow Palette - Trying this out as for someone who's chinita, I'm gravitating towards Asian make-up brands rather than Western. Tones are softer and much lighter. Shimmers are also smooth when glided on.
6. Romand Lucky Bags - These are what I'm most excited about! In Japan New Year's, some beauty brands such as Romand release discounted lucky bags!
For the Cool Tone box : Got 1 palette, 1 mascara, 1 glitter liquid eyeshadow, plus 5 lip products for only PHP1,800!

For the Warm Tone box - Got 1 small eyeshadow palette, 1 Glassy Tone-up cream, 1 Glassy Bomb Tint and a par of ribbon clips for PHP800 (Available in Lawson)

OTHERS
1. Roihi-Tsuboko Patches - As a tita, this Japan salon pass is a must.

1bycjo8,"🚨 BEAUTY NEWS ROUNDUP: New releases from BLK, GRWM, ChuChu. Sneak peeks from Jelly Eugenio's collab collection, upcoming releases from Sunnies, Detail, Colourette, Maybelline, Klued & more! 🔍👀 


📣 BLK has started rolling out in physical stores their dupe/alternative for the CT & ELF illuminators called the ""Radiant Glow Filter"" and ""Lip Quench"" tinted lip balms with SPF. It's also interesting to note that the word 'Complexion' is printed and misspelled as COMPEXION on all the bottles of this illuminator I've seen posted so far. Does that bother anyone else considering how long it takes to develop, finalize, and release a new product? Excited for the reviews & comparisons vs other local illuminators from GRWM and Lovely since this one claims to be waterproof & sweat-resistant.


📣 GRWM held a launch event and started a new campaign for their Seaside Glam Collection consisting of multi-use sticks with 7 blushes, 5 bronzers, 3 contours, & 3 highlighters in faux metallic + ribbed acrylic packaging. Did anyone else expect more from this collection like something that makes more sense for hot weather season like a cooling face mist maybe or a primer sunscreen? I think Issy's summer 2022 launch with a similar concept made more sense with their solar lip balm, face mist, & cream bronzers.


📣 Chuchu Beauty has released their new Cyber Hearts collection with Lip Pods mini lipstick duos in 6 shades/3 pairs, and Heart Paint liquid blushes in 6 shades. It's cutesy, gimmicky, and not pricey – perfect for a younger target demographic. At first thought, it's like don't we have enough liquid blushes in the market at this point but really it kinda makes sense to get this Heart Paint and pair it with their viral bestselling Heart Powder Duo blushes if you love their aesthetic or if you still don't have a liquid blush.


📣 Jelly Eugenio has confirmed in one of his social media posts that his upcoming collab makeup collection has been delayed but is finally coming this month. Screenshots from his previous posts show a palette called ""Pretty Sweet"" and it looks like it is a face & eye palette(?). He also showed a preview of the box packaging of his travel brush set. Which brand do you guys think it is? I think it's a collab with Vice Cosmetics. No registrations found yet on the fda portal though.


📣 Sunnies Face is gearing up to launch new products called ""Lash Seeker"" (guessing it's a waterproof mascara since their last mascara wasn't waterproof or this could be a lash serum?), ""Blush On"" (a long lasting cheek pigment daw, possibly their answer to criticism that their air blush and other products aren't longwearing), ""Lip Glaze"" (another Rhode peptide lip treatment dupe?), ""Lifebrow flexible sculpting grooming gel"" (slightly different from their already released one which is ""an all-day clear setting gel""), and a ""Dream Serum"" (to pair with their Dream Cream?).


📣 Detail's next launch might be called the ""Lip Leisure"" according to the fda portal. Tried getting more info from one of Detail's livestreams and asked if it's a gloss or a balm. They said it's a lipstick. No word yet on the formula. Probably glossy or satin since their last release, Power Lip, is matte.


📣 Squad is preparing to launch a bunch of new products. This could be in line with their current rebranding or shifting of aesthetics as seen on their recent releases like their setting spray, brow gel, primer, etc. Squad's newly released affordable setting spray is also performing well and holding up in comparison tests on tiktok against popular setting sprays from Zeesea, Dazzle Me, GRWM, etc


📣 Colourette is planning to add 8 more new shades to their First Base Skin Tint which currently has 12 shades (as referenced in the photo). The new shade names are called ""Bonbon, Calatagan, Mati, Oslob, Donsol, La Union, Nacpan, & Anda"". They also recently added new shades to their Colourbalms.


📣 Maybelline has registered in the PH their ""Superstay Double Fixer Setting Spray"" and their ""Super Lock Brow Glue/Brow Setting Gel"" and that means these will launch in the next few weeks. Looks like these are already available for sale in a few other countries and Maybelline is really leaning into this lavender aesthetic for their new launches.


📣 Klued is about to release their own sunscreen. After releasing a new barrier support jelly cleanser, a new multi-brightening serum, and a new multi-hyaluronic serum, the brand is finally coming out soon with their own sunscreen. This would be a great addition to their line and would make an all-Klued skincare routine essentially complete.


📣 Ms Bella of Saipo Skin is teasing a new sunscreen stick in a pink ribbed acrylic packaging. Could this be for her brand Saipo or for Fairy Skin? Also shown in this photo are sunscreen sticks from Happy Skin, BLK, Luxe Organix, Belo, & Hello Glow. Did I miss anything? Glad to see we now have a lot of sunscreen stick options from local brands.


That's all for now. Try not to get overwhelmed and only buy what you need, the 2nd quarter of the year has just begun. Stay tuned for more local beauty news in this subreddit.

1hbv9su,"Overrated and underrated local makeup and skincare products I’ll start.

Overrated:
Anything by sunnies face. Never pa ako na impress sa products nila other than packaging. They just copy trending products pero not even half the quality.

Lip Mallow. Before you boo me I like the formula and own 6 of them. Pero honestly after trying more local products, overpriced talaga lip mallow. Yung shade range is basically so one note and after dry down you kinda need just one color. Plus ang onti niya lang talaga.

VMV Hypoallergenics. Honestly masakit to sa akin kasi it was ahead of its time. Skincare made for sensitive Filipino skin. Pero ngayon imo napagiwanan na siya. More local skincare are entering the market and syempre Korean brands that are competitive and deliver quality. VMV is too expensive now with all these available brands

Underrated
Detail lip liner. I’ll choose this over any of my expensive lip liners. Super the best I tried.

Ever Bilena stain. The OG. The Filipina girl basics. Pero tried and tested, ito talaga yung di ka iiwan kahit anong pawis mo pa. I remember choosing this over my benetint.

Ellana cosmetics. Always there for sensitive skin pero not everyone has recognized her. Ito for me isa pa sa pioneer ng for Filipina sensitive skin and very reasonable and prices.

Hirap pumili kung alin dun sa dalawa ang pipiliin kaya medyo kabado bente kung tama ba yung makukuha kong shade 😆 Donsol yung inorder ko at may kasamang dasal na sana hindi masayang yung pera na tama naman sana ang shade 😄

1icm7kf,"makeup products i swear by ~ nars sheer glow foundation (salzburg): i’ve only had this for about a month, but i’m already obsessed. it evens out my skin tone without feeling heavy at all. i’ve sweat through a whole day, and it’s still there. i have combo-to-oily skin, and it sits so nicely, no clinging to lines and dry patches. 

con: i swatched it in-store (sm aura), ordered online, and while the shade was close, it’s still a bit too yellow for me (seems to be the case with most nars foundations). i probably should’ve gone with gobi or deauville instead, but the saleslady swore this was the perfect match 😭 now, i mix it with my grwm blue radiance tint to balance it out. 

~ maybelline superstay lumimatte foundation (119 & 115): i was honestly done with maybelline foundations, but my sister convinced me to try this, and wow. it’s officially my favorite drugstore foundation. i get so many compliments when i wear it. it’s not exactly like nars, but it definitely holds up against high-end ones.

the only thing is that, like nars, it’s a little too yellow for me. also, it oxidizes, so keep an eye on that.

~ kiko milano unlimited double touch (103 natural rose & 120 rosy mauve): i’m not even kidding when i say i’m never trying another lipstick again. i’ve heard people say this dries their lips, and i get it. but if you prep with a little vaseline, it’s fine. i never have to touch up. gym, dinner, late nights, it stays.

~ strokes clear brow gel: i almost gave up on this because it flakes like crazy at first, but once i figured out the trick, i love it. it keeps my brows locked in place, even in the heat. the key is not to layer it over other products on your face, or you’ll get flakes. also, don’t apply too much—i recommend dispensing the gel on the dispenser before applying it to your brows to avoid any excess. i tried absidy before, and while it’s good, strokes is just on another level for holding power.

~ naturactor cover face concealer (shade 151): not in the picture, but this concealer is a game changer. i’ve been using it for months and i barely need to reapply. a little goes a long way to cover blemishes, and it looks so natural. i don’t use it around my nose (it separates there), but for everything else, it’s perfect. i actually decluttered all my other concealers because this is the only one i reach for now.

1n4uajc,"Types of people you meet in beautycon2025 Attended different dates ng beautycon and the 1st day was the best one… in my opinion! :)

Here are the types of people I’ve encountered during the said event (katuwaan lang!):

1. **Rich Kikays** - ganda manamit, pak na pak ang hair and makeup, madaming bitbit at laman ang mga basket, branded ang bags and shoes ng mga ate. 
2. **Budget Kikays** - ganda manamit din sila, usually mga students or young 20s, and hindi masyado madami laman ng basket. Nag set ng limit before entering and nasunod nila yun. 
3. **Bored boyfies and hubbies** - napapaupo na lang sa men zone, bitbit ang tote bags ng girl nila, and kitang kita mo sa mukha nila na they had enough.
4. **The UGC influencers** - hogging every walking space known imaginable to mankind, may bitbit silang recognizable tote bag kaya alam mong contacted ng beautycon admins, may dalang mic and lights yung iba, ayaw umalis sa mga booths for photos/vlogging
5. **The Hoarders** - grabe akala mo apocalypse na with the way they hoard, talagang tinitake advantage ang deals, proceeds to buy the same 10 shampoos and lotions. Simot ang booth!
6. **The Criminals** - day 1 & 2 madami mga nahuli na shoplifters, nung day 3 naka witness ako personally ng shoplifting sa chu chu beauty (got it on video yung girl, not the act itself lmao). 
7. **Gutom Gang** - Sa sobrang pagod, kumakain habang roaming the area. Maamoy mo yung bitbit nilang nachos. Magugutom ka pero maiisip mo sa sarili “what if matapon ko, nakakahiya!!”.
8. **Freebie Addicts** - pumasok ng walang balak bumili, lumabas ng madaming freebies! Winner!!! 
9. **Kikay Gamers** - add to cart nila mga wishlist nila, magaling sa booth games (pinko ball, claw machine, golf, etc) kaya yung freebies nila 2x the amount of the usual.

*Edited*

10. **Impatient Titas** (by u/randomfan777) - may energy sa simula, natuwa sa deals, pero nung nakita ang cashier line - ktnxbye. 

11. **Smart Girlfriends** - dala nila si #3 sa convention para may ~~taga bitbit ng freebie tote bags~~ companionship. If may skill or luck issue sa laro, it’s ok; their baby’s got em. Twice ang freebies: one for the girl, one for the ~~guy~~ girl again.

12. **Great Wall of Barkada** - Hindi drawing ang gala, natuloy sa beautycon! Masikip ang booths dahil lahat sila andoon. Lahat sila nag swswatch sabay sabay. Yung free photbooths na gusto mo? Andoon din sila. 

13. **Fanatics** - Gusto maka meet ng artista. Present sa events and meetups. Sinusundan ang fave artista and influencer nila sa venue.

I used the front camera of my phone (Xiaomi Poco X3 Pro) and it kind of washed out the color of my makeup so I adjusted the contrast and sharpness to 10 just so the color would show on camera. No filter used.

btw, I just wanted to thank all of you guys who commented on my last post. I deeply appreciate all of your comments and suggestions ❤️

1hl5jb0,"Reddit made me buy! As a lurker here, these are the things that I bought based on your reviews!
* Silk Secrets Keratin - manipis buhok ko and other Keratin products just make my hair flat. It’s only ₱ 189.00 kaya I decided to give it a try na! It made my hair straighter but I think amoy chemical…? Hahaha.

For the makeup, I stopped pushing dark red blush on & lippies on me🥲 It makes my skin dull & makes me look older. I realized coral pink & peach suits me better. Any more peach blush ons please?

* EB Pillow Pop Liquid (Toast of New York) - it was either this or the Fresno, but I think more on pink pa rin than peach. Saw good reviews from this and ₱ 199.00 na lang now kaya I gave it a try. Ginamit ko this after using a brush. ‘Yung products na nasa wand pa lang ng applicator pero my god, totoo nga, it’s pigmented. I just hope they’ll release more shades.
* EB Blush (Rosy Glow) - I actually wanted to try the Careline Oil Control Blush in Tangerine pero 3 shades lang meron sa malaking Watsons sa amin🥲 Or Peachy Pink but again, super limited ng shades available samin. Hay.
* Pretty Secret Brow on-the-Go - Not really an eyebrow girlie since ‘di ako marunong but I gave it a try and it does staaay!

ADDITIONAL:

•EB Serum Tinted Lip Gloss (Melon) - It doesn’t lip a stain when you remove it pero I like the smell. This came off as a nude, maybe next time I’ll get the Punch or Moon Glow. Iba kasi ang color ng box sa color ng product.
* Careline Sheer Up! Tinted Gloss - not sure about the gloss but it’s pretty pigmented kaso I don’t like lang how it looks so dark na on my lips.

Just a little background, I’m just starting to really learn more about make up & hair care. I’ve been a red girlie but I realized since I have a neutral undertone and di ako morena nor maputi, peach shades look good on me I guess. I used to have the Pretty Secret Lip & Cheek Soft Glow Tint in Vibrant Peach but I can’t find it anymoreee.

Feel free to give me suggestions on peach blushes & lippies!",https://i.redd.it/8cw80hsk2q8e1.jpeg,399,40,Review,careline,local,"blush, blushes, eyebrow, brow, lip gloss, brush, makeup",,2024-12-24,Neutral

141eu8i,"Discovered an app that shows price history of products listed in Shopee & Lazada I recently found this website/app that shows you the trend of the prices of a specific product listed in different e-commerce websites (Shopee, Lazada, Watsons, BeautyMNL). Naisipan ko na rin i-share dito para makatulong. Makakaiwas na tayo sa budol ng mga sale prices lol. It's ""***biggo.ph***""  or *BigGo Shopping.*

Tip lang dapat maging accurate yung ita-type niyo sa search bar para makita mo na agad yung product na galing sa official store. So dapat same yung product name ng official store sa ilalagay mo sa search bar. Maraming results ang lalabas, but you can check the sellers name na katabi ng product, to know if tama ang product ang naka-show.

PS. Example lang itong issy & co. nakita ko kasi may 6.6 sale sila ngayon. Sinubukan ko i-check sa app if Php259 na ba talaga lowest price ng active concealers. And it looks like naging Php279 na siya last 11.11 and 12.12 sale. So sulit na rin bilhin ngayon.

1ipbckd,"Started investing in high-end hygiene, skincare, and makeup, products What do you think about the products I use?

These are my holy grails:
1. Hada Labo toner/lotion. Nawala pagiging flaky ng mukha ko since I started using it. I have a super dry skin kaya Thank God, pagpalain nawa nakaimbento ng Hada Labo.

2. Anessa Sunscreen. Best sunscreen ever. As a person na laging bilad sa site, hindi masyadong sunog mukha ko. Anlayo ng color compare sa braso ko. Di ko na din need mag primer. I believe nakakabata talaga pag gamit ng sunscreen religiously, as it can reduce premature skin aging. Nanghihina ako pag di ako nakakapaglagay ng anessa sunscreen.

3.  Rare Beauty Highlighter. Ang ganda ng lapat sa mukha. Feeling ko kpop star ako pag nakahighlighter, kumikinang parang nagiging hawig ko na si winter ng aespa. 

4. Rare Beauty Blush. Very pigmented. Ang healthy tingnan ng mukha, na eelevate nya talaga yung look para di mukhang lifeless. From dull to doll. 

5. Chanel Skin Tint and Mac Strobe cream. Combo sila kasi glittery yung mac so need ko pa patungan ng chanel para malessen and may very light coverage anddd ang hydrating nila tingnan sa face ko like legit, ang glowy! nagiging kamukha ko si Jennie. Madalas di na ko gumamit ng foundation if I want to have the natural makeup look, yan lang sapat na.

6. Lancome La Vie Est Belle perfume. Binili ko to kahit di ko pa naaamoy, kasi gandang ganda lang ako sa bote hahaha judged the book by its cover and and buti naman nabanguhan ako. Legit na napapalingon lahat pag naaamoy nila to, alexa play whi-whiplash. Wag lang talagang sosobrahan spray kasi matapang, nakakahilo. 

7. Tsubaki Hair mask. Kahit isang gamitan palang, banlawan mo agad, kitang kita na agad ang good effects. Grabe bat ang gaganda ng Japanese products hiyang na hiyang sakin.

It retails at ₱150, much cheaper than other local powders and it performs well.

I’m a dry skin girlie. So, I don’t oil up much. I think it’s also perfect for no textured faces.

1i9mtrx,"Salon Keratin Treatment Experience I haven't seen a lot of posts about Keratin treatment in this sub, so I'm posting this for reference in case anyone's thinking of availing this service from salons. 

For context, I have thick, frizzy, curly hair. Kahit yung gumawa ng hair ko sa salon sabi nya hindi lang makapal yung buhok ko, pero pati yung strands mismo are thick. I didn't plan on having my hair treated tbh, gusto ko sana magpakulay pero nasales talk ako para daw hindi super damaged ang hair ko, and para maging manageable na din yung friziness nya. 

I had it done at Moon's beauty salon in Pampanga. As you can see from the picture, my hair isn't straight unless styled, pero hindi na ganun ka-frizzy. Naretain yung softness and shine ng buhon ko. The treatment smells bad though and it took me around 5-6 washes with scented products para mawala yung amoy. 

All in all, I'm happy with it. It made my hair manageable and low maintenance. Hindi na din effort magblowdry para lang mastyle ko buhok ko. A few passes with a blowout brush and straight na sya. And what I love the most is hindi super flat and straight ang hair ko, compared to hair rebonding. 

Price isn't cheap though, and it only lasts 3-6 months depende kung inaalagaan mo. In my case, I switched to a sulfate free shampoo (Loreal Ever Pure Frizz Defy Shampoo) and used a hair mask once a week (Tsubaki Premium Ex Hair Mask) pero my hair routine is still the same. (Keratin Conditioner, Elizavecca Protein Ion Injection once a week)

So to anyone with frizzy hair or curly hair na mas prefer ang straight hair, I'd recommend doing a keratin treatment if you have the budget.

1gd3nss,"Swatched all my mac lippies. Because why not. Skin tone: Nc 20-25

Random thoughts:
--absolutely like the new maxcimal formula better than the old one. And Warm Teddy is so much better on warm tone skin than Velvet teddy and Spirit, both serviceable nudes but they tend to make teeth look yellow and give washed out appearance in the wrong light. Warm teddy has none of those issues, it's so flattering and I hope more pinays try it lol

--creme in your coffee is one of the closest lippies I've ever found to my actual lip color. A true mlbb.

--mocha is a nice terracotta on me, but virtually all brands have shades just like this. Like a lot of sunnies and colourette colors swatch up the same

--Mull It Over is my only powder kiss lipstick from MAC. Love love love the texture when I feel like wearing a lightweight matte. It also has a lovely brightening effect on my overall look, as a coral pink that's not overpowering or too cool/fake

--Marrakesh (along with Mull It Over and Warm Teddy) is among my top 3 favorite MAC lippies. It has an amazing opaque creaminess that wears so well and fades away evenly. I'm not big on reds, tend to give most of them away, but this one I love. My favorite intense warm red.

--Coffee and Cigs is your classic 90s browney mauve lip. This is from their Love Me line and it has apparently been discontinued w/c is a bit disappointing because this was a versatile formula I liked. You can apply it lightly for a kind of translucent ""black honey"" effect or really layer it on for a more dramatic vampy vibe. Top 4 in my collection (at least partly because I don't want to get too attached to something I can't repurchase haha)

1hhlc4o,"Ranking my local blushes From lowest to highest, also not seen here pero I’ll add sa ranking my careline oil control blush. I just finished it and I won’t buy a new one muna kasi I have loads of blush to finish pa. For reference, I have oily skin and paghapon lalabas at lalabas ang shine. 

9. Squad Happy Pot - I’ll begin by saying I actually like all of my blushes. Squad happy pot is bang for its price. Super pigmented and ganda ng color range. It has decent longevity for its price, pero it’s on the weaker side on the blushes that I own. You will need to reapply along the day. I actually prefer it better sa eyelids ko, parang mas dun siya tumatagal. Ang pinaka reklamo ko dito is during hotter seasons, medyo nagwawax and namamasa siya. So ayun, pangit siya gamitin pag summer.

8. Detail colour tonic - weakest color payoff of the blushes that I own. Actually edge nito over happy pot for me is walang waxiness factor. Halos same lang longevity nila ni happy pot. I enjoy how easy it is to carry around though. Also since more muted ito than my other blushes, I guess I reach out for this when I do my strong lip and eye makeup.
 
7. Detail velvet blush - papunta na tayo sa mga kaya ng whole day blushes. You need to set this one para talagang whole day, pero maganda longevity niya naman even without. Similar so color tonic, I find this isn’t as pigmented as my other blushes, pero very easy to build naman. Very soft nitong blush na to. Ang ayaw ko lang talaga dito, naloko ako sa shades. Malayo yung swatches sa lazada/shopee in real life. Best siguro go to a physical store to buy this.

6. Squad Soft blush - I love this blush. No notes ako halos except may tendency rin siya to wax on hotter weathers. Di siya kasing heavily pigmented than happy pot, pero it still has great color payoff and also means it’s easier to control when you’re applying. Lasts all day when you set it.

5. Hello Glow serum blush - all the blushes moving forward, no notes. Labanan na lang sa lasting power, shades, bang for the buck, and overall performance. This blush is perfect talaga sa no makeup makeup. It’s similar to the happy skin color adapt, pero on serum form. It’s longevity depends on the amount you put. Wala ako qualm dito, siguro advice ko lang is you need to try this sa store muna. I am very white, so idk how morena friendly this is kasi ang labas niya sa akin is a natural light pinkish flush. 

4. Ever Bilena powder blush - alam niyo, feel ko talaga di na ako bibili ng Nars. As an oily girl, this lasts all day talaga. Yes you have to set it, pero basta di mainit whole day pa rin. Sobrang pigmented nito and nice ang shade range. Note lang may glitters to na medyo prominent, so yun yung reason bakit mas mababa siya than may 3rd choice.

3. Careline oil control blush - No notes. Like if naghahanap ka ng powder blush, run na to your nearest watsons. Sa sobrang ganda nito, nasosoldout talaga siya. My oily girls out there. Do not doubt na.

2. Ever Bilena liquid blush - I made a separate post na on this. My most used makeup product probably. Only flaw lang nito sa akin is limited shades, pero ito ang literal na bang for the buck. 

1. Ever Bilena lip and cheek stain - tried and tested since high school days. Gamit ko sa gym, nanood ako uaap, sinubok ang summer days ng Pilipinas, tried and tested, always reliable. Babalik at babalik ako dito. Ito ang blush na actually, parang gumaganda pa nga siya sayo pag pinawisan ka kasi it gives you a glow. You don’t need to set this na, di ka niya iiwan. I think siguro only flaw if you even call it that, is I would consider this an everyday blush but not necessarily an event blush. Pero, kaya nga andyan blushes above to do the job. Personally my dazzling barbie from eb does an amazing job. Pero ayun, unbeatable talaga itong eb stain on this climate and on my oily skin.

For the longest time, never ako nakagamit ng mascara that can hold up the curl. Babagsak at babagsak talaga after ilang hours. I also tried lash perm pero hindi rin tumatagal. Lash extensions? Nah, mahilig ako magkusot ng mata tapos nakalbo rin lashes ko. 🥲

1j4tzgq,"RIP to the best ever lipstick My staple lipstick has always been the MAC mocha satin (813). Since last year, it apparently has been discontinued. I learned about it late, so I wasn't able to buy backups. Tinipid ko na lang talaga ang last lipstick ko kahit nagsesweat na yung oils niya. Anyway, I passed by SM today and saw their new reformulated lipsticks. I searched for mocha, pero bago na siya - Cafe Mocha macximal matte (683) na siya. When I tested it, sobrang subtle, pero you can tell na iba siya sa dating Mocha. I still liked it so I bought one. I tried comparing it with my old MAC and Dior dupe. For those who love the old Mac satin Mocha, here's a swatch comparison of the popular shade.

The Dior one is far more expensive, but it's the closest to the old mocha. I think it just has a bit more brown in it kaya sometimes it looks slightly more mature on me. Meanwhile, the new Cafe Mocha looks brighter and probably has more peach or orange in it, giving it a younger feel. Being morena, sobrang tricky nito coz sometimes it can come off as neon. Talagang the old Mocha is the best. I've never had any problems with it whether I get more tan or light. Morena girl problems.

So wala lang, share ko lang to to everyone. RIP MAC Mocha satin. You will forever be loved. Nothing will ever replace you, not even new reformulations or sidechick dupes. Hope this helps a fellow Mocha-lover out there!

14l21th,"I finally achieved the makeup capsule of my dreams. Context: I struggled the past few years with overspending on makeup. On top of the hit it took on my finances, I ended up with way more makeup than I’ll ever use up. I realized that I don’t even get to enjoy good products because they’d usually go bad before I can really use them or I just completely forget that I own them. 

Over the course of this year, I started to do mini declutters but still found myself overwhelmed by the number of products I had. So this week, I decided to really buckle down and only keep the ones I really use on a regular basis. Depending on the category, I used different strategies to really narrow my collection down to something that I’m comfortable with.

EYES: Gone are the days when I used huge eyeshadow palettes with more colors than I really need. Two years ago, I discovered Laura Mercier eyeshadow sticks and never went back. I did allow myself some smaller palettes and single eyeshadows but I became very conscious about the color. After  wearing stage makeup for more than 10 years, I have a much better idea of what colors really work with my skin tone. I also don’t really use eyeliners anymore and only keep one mascara at a time since that has to be replaced every couple of months anyway.

COMPLEXION: This was a relatively easy one for me. I didn’t have much of this category to begin with and I have a better grasp of my skin tone and undertone now. I was able to narrow it down to 2 concealers (for undereye and spot concealing), 1 skin tint, 1 powder foundation (for occasional events), 1 stick foundation, 1 powder bronzer, 1 stick bronzer/contour, 1 cream highlighter, and 1 setting powder. All of these are my HG and are perfect for the skin I have now.

BLUSH: I had to admit something very important — that I actually don’t like blush that much to justify the number that I owned. As I got older I appreciated having a more subtle blush with a more precise application so I only kept the ones whose color was either native to my skin tone or mimics my natural flush. That meant saying goodbye to all the trendy blush colors (looking at you, lilac purple) that made my skin look strange. Now I’m confident that all 6 of my remaining blushes will get some love.

LIPS: This was the tough one. I started with over 60 lip products (!!!) because this is my favorite makeup category. First, I disposed of all the lippies that were older than a year. Yes, this meant letting go of some HGs and some luxury items but I realized that I hadn’t even used those the last few months and probably won’t even miss them. Next, I set aside the lip colors that I stopped wearing because they looked weird on my skin tone (I have a cool olive undertone, iykyk) and gave them away to close friends and family. And finally, I swatched the remaining lippies to remove color dupes. I ended up with 5 tinted lip balms, 2 lip oils, 1 lip gloss, 2 lip liners, 1 glossy lip tint, 1 velvet lip tint, 1 liquid lipstick, 5 sheer matte lipsticks (a fave subcategory) and 5 traditional bullet lipsticks. 23 lip products still sounds like a lot, but they all have a specific use case in my mind and I know I will get to use them all.


Final thoughts: this honestly was a fun exercise for me. Not only do I enjoy a more tightly curated makeup wardrobe, but I also have more guidance for future purchases. I’ll definitely be more mindful of what I buy, if I will even be motivated to buy at all.",https://i.redd.it/683cgn3qgp8b1.jpg,370,46,Shelfie,laura mercier,international,"foundation, concealer, concealers, powder, blush, blushes, highlighter, bronzer, contour, eyeshadow, eyeshadows, eyeliner, eyeliners, mascara, palette, palettes, lipstick, lipsticks, lip gloss, lip liner, lip liners, lip balm, lip balms, skin tint, makeup",,2023-06-28,Neutral

1i7coi5,"colourette first base is so good, it lightened my mole. i've always been tempted or interested to try out colourette's first base skin tint after i've read its reviews online. the only thing that really pulled me back from purchasing is its price. as a student, i cannot bring myself to justify its price point vs. its volume. sa isip isip ko, i'd rather buy a foundation na talaga. (i use issy as my funda everyday).

but my ate bought herself this skin tint and i just knew i had to try it. siyempre as bunso hingi hingi lang muna, para na rin matest kung gusto ko ba talaga before i make a purchase. 🤪

sobrang konti lang ng nilagay ko but look at it!! sobrang flawless ng finish niya to the point na nalighten up niya yung mole ko sa may bibig. nagulat ako cuz not even my heavy coverage foundations could do that haha. i only used primer, concealer, and first base as my base layer then proceeded to bronze my face and put on blush.

so ayan, najustify ko naman na ang presyo. kaya pala, ang ganda naman pala kasi HAHA so napabili rin ako ng akin ng wala sa oras lol

Whenever I do my late night Tiktok scrolling, lagi narerecommend ang Teviant live when he is hosting. Nacucurious ako on what he has to say so napapa-tune in ako.

Aside from his chikas about what Heart Evangelista wears sa makeup line niya, he is also providing makeup tips and tricks.

What I particularly like sa live niya is yung pag bibigay niya ng foundation shade recommendation. For example, someone in the stream asked about ano yung shade match niya sa Teviant if she’s NC20 sa Mac. He recommended Eggshell. For Fiji ng NARS, he recommended his Seravalle in his concealer line and Shortcake sa foundation (water based daw) line niya. 

So far, natrtry ko pa lang sa Teviant is yung eyebrow product nila. I’m curious tuloy if legit ba yung shade match or what.

1iqqj42,"my before and after acne journey Sharing with you my acne journey—grabe, ang stressful magkaroon ng adult acne! Way back in high school, hindi ako masyadong nagkakapimples, but when I got to college, dun na nagsimula. My pimples got worse when I started working, especially since I’m in the engineering field. Lagi akong nasa site, so maalikabok, at sensitive ang skin ko sa heat and dust.

Then, I decided to get my skin checked (Hi, Dr. Jaja!), and charaaan! This has been my progress! Though there are still A LOT of visible marks and scars, the improvement is 👏👏👏

• Physiogel Dermocleanser
• Benzoyl Peroxide 5% Gel (Benzac)
• Adapalene 0.1% + Clindamycin Gel (Klenzit CMS)
• Azelaic Acid 10% Serum (Ellana Minerals)
• Soul Apothecary Radiance Boost Serum

1hjy9ij,"Local lip oil ranking Before the year ends and magagawa ko new years resolution ko of being matipid, rarank ko na my current makeup obsession. From lowest to highest:

8. Dr. Sensitive - this isn’t a lip oil. You can’t convince me that it’s a lip oil. The product itself isn’t bad per se, pero di talaga siya lip oil guys. Wag kayo pabudol if hanap niyo lip oil. That said ang ganda ng shades niya ngl. I consider and use this as a tint. It doesn’t dry my lips, pero it doesn’t hydrate it either. Note though, may chance tong sumabog. 

7. Squad - this is the cheapest of the bunch. Even cheaper than Dr. Sensitive and Luxe. It’s an ok lip oil. Definitely the thinnest of the bunch, pero it’s still hydrating enough. I currently use this for my lip prep since it’s thin enough that it won’t affect the formulation of my lippie of the day. I also use this as a gloss sometimes. Alam niyo yung pag nag fade na lippie niyo and uneven na. Ginagamit ko to kasi inieven out niya yung leftover stain and nagbibigay pa ng shine. 

6. Luxe Organix - it’s not really a lip oil, pero add na natin yan. This product is actually really good. Ganda ng pigmentation and hydration. Ayun lang I have two major issues dito. One, may chance sasabog siya. Second, may times di even labas niya so ayun performance issues. It’s cheap enough that I can tolerate it though, di ko na lang siya nilalabas ng bahay ko though. 

5. BLK - this is the most pigmented of the bunch so if hanap niyo is opacity, this is the one for you. It’s not as hydrating as the products below though. I also gave it a lower rating than the products below kasi nagleleak siya from time to time and apparently marami akong friends na experience na rin yan kaya it’s really a packaging flaw. 

4. Detail - to be clear this is a lip plumper not a lip oil. Pero sinama ko siya kasi imo mas lip oil talaga dating niya sa akin. I will have to warn na yes may anghang siya, so if mahina kayo dyan you might not enjoy this. It is very hydrating though and really makes your lips look moisturized. The shade range is also quite good. 

3-2. Careline and Ever Bilena - same ranking sila for me. I prefer Ever Bilena’s thinner wand kasi it’s easier to apply evenly. Pero Careline’s shade range gives it a push. They’re the second most pigmented after blk. They’re really moisturizing and ang ganda ng stain na iniiwan nito sa lips. The quality for the price point is really unbeatable. If you’re new to lip oils, suggest ko pick either one kasi they’re really good starter products.

1. Strokes - ito na. Kunin niyo na lahat ng local lippies ko wag lang ito. This is the most hydrating of the bunch. Ang ganda pa ng effect nito kasi it makes your lips look plump and glossy. This can really compete with luxury brand lip oils imo. Lagi ako nababati when I use this product. Note lang, there’s a small chance din na mag leak siya at times. Not as lala ng blk though. Also yung tempting red, pag closeup nagsesettle siya sa lines ng lips mo. Pero other than that, perfect na siya for me. 

Natry ko rin happy skin, pero nag leak siya and tinapon ko. Parang for that reason gusto ko siya ilast pero ngl maganda formula niya kaya I don’t want to be too unfair. Kaya sasabihin ko na lang buy at your own risk kasi it’s more expensive than the ones on the list.

Btw the careline I have now is limited edition and mukhang mawawala na siya soon. Careline just released new lip oils na madaming shades and even more pigmented than the blk one. Goal ko rin matry issy and grwm lip oil in the future.",https://i.redd.it/8soer7kxge8e1.jpeg,358,65,Review,"ever bilena, blk, belo, happy skin, issy, dr. sensitive, grwm, careline","local, local, local, local, local, local, local, local",makeup,,2024-12-22,Neutral

I'm especially happy with getting a new skin tint and concealer cause gurl ang orange na ng Maybelline ones ko and they don't hold well anymore throughout the day 😭 makes my under eyes look so ashy pa. For lipstick naman, tiniis ko gamitin yung nag iisang years-old product na meron ko since jhs from miniso haha 🥹

Ang saya saya talaga sa feeling huhu. These will last me a couple of years uli 😆


List of products + reviews of the ones I've tried using:


- Dasique Berry Smoothie 18 shades palette


- NYX color correcting concealer


- Canmake Tokyo blush in the shade P01
Super love it na may onting pagka sparkle siya (hindi naman enough to look like a highlighter) and may kasamang brush narin :) The shade is very perfect pang natural look and its consistency is parang halo ng powder and cream. This lasts me the whole day too (oily girl here) basta magpowder ako before putting it on.


- e.l.f eyeshadow palette in Cream & Sugar
It's a very ordinary eyeshadow palette that gets the job done.


- The Body Shop blushes in the shade Guava
Yes, they're somehow both in the shade Guava? Maybe it's a cool-tone / warm-tone thing. Luma na yung nasa transparent container and recently ko lang nagagamit dahil now ko lang din nagustuhan yung color haha. It's such a cute yet natural plum shade! Very easy to work with din as it's a powder. The other one was gifted to me lang (haven't tried yet).


- First Base Mini by Colourette in the shade Mati
Haven't worn it outside yet but omg perfect shade match sakin when i rubbed it on my hand 😱


- Serum Concealer by Lucky Beauty in the shade Porcelain
Kakatry ko lang kanina and wow super lightweight lang siya! So far, hindi rin nag ccrease or nagiging patchy anywhere. Di lang ganun kabigat yung coverage kaya kita parin eyebags ko (but that might just be me with ugly purply eyebags haha kaya ittry ko ito with the color corrector soon).


- Romand Glasting Gloss in the shade Peony Ballet
Absolutely love this! Gives such a pretty shine to my lips. Ang bango pa ng amoy hahaha. Medyo sheer nga lang color ni Peony Ballet, I wanted something natural-looking lang kasi. Hindi rin pala nagllast long, matatanggal din when you eat or drink. My tip is to not smack your lips when you put this on para mamaintan yung pretty and smooth na shine niya. Let the applicator do the job if you missed any spots.


- Romand Juicy Lasting Tint in Bare Grape
Alam niyo bang sobrang tagal ko nang umiiwas sa lip tints dahil ang pangit lagi ng experience ko with it dati. Laging sa bottom lip lang kumakapit. But this one's really nice! It goes on really well sa upper lip ko. Pero tama nga yung iba na hindi siya ganun ka shiny on the lips and the color darkens pa over time. It has great staining tho! I used it once for 3 days straight and grabe yung color stain sa lips ko.


- Sunnies Face Fluffmate in the shade Nudist
Really pretty natural brown-ish shade :) doesn't last long of course dahil bullet lipstick and wala ring staining properties.


- The Body Shop lip & cheek stain in the shade Pink Hibiscus


- MAC Lipglass Mini in the shade Love Child


- Innisfree No Sebum Mineral Powder (loose version)


- Missha Ultra Powerproof Mascara
My new mascara HG? Doesn't budge at all and doesn't give me panda eyes (hindi tulad ni Maybelline na laging umiitim pa lalo eyebags ko pag hapon na). Very waterproof din! Love this so much.

1lcg819,"Makeup Hypes I Don't Get 1. Lip Oils
- The shade and shine may be nice, but why not just buy tinted lip balms, detail glass stains, or tinted lip glosses?
- Fresh akong papasok sa class, then back to being maputla na yung lips ko after.
- I bought lip oils from careline and colourette, but they don't even last for two hours. I just don't get the hype when tinted lip balms are much better when it comes to color, moisturization, and longevity.
- Also, lip oils are too pricey.

2. Maybelline Base Products 
- The skin tint's performance depends on the weather for me. Overall, it's usable.
- However, the foundations and concealers are all so drying. I never bought any base products from Maybelline kasi swatch pa lang parang semento na. 
- I don't get why people trust their base products and why there are still content creators who promote them. It seems like budol eh :((

3. Jelly Blushes
- they're just solidified lip tints
- Careline and EB lip tints pa rin especially now that they have other shades and are still affordable. 

4. Chinese Makeup Products 
- namely pinkflash, focallure, o.two.o, sace lady, etc.
- These brands have already infiltrated the Philippine cosmetics industry. Although you see these brands in drugstores and malls, they can't still be trusted.
- Brands with products that are not fda-approved just can't be trusted. Kahit pa sabihin mong hindi nagbebenta sa malls ng potentially unsafe products, these brands constantly sell them online. 
- When I had my suspicions and did my research months ago, I found out that they just change the names of the products that are non-fda-approved online. They also change the name of the variations and sometimes the packaging or pictures pero these are the same products with the same ingredients. The FDA certification of the certain products may not even be aligned with the description of the products they are selling. So when you search them, it's possible na wala kang mahanap na public health warning about them.
- They may be cheap but they can be harmful. I may get bashed pero for me these are the real bangketa makeups na low price, low quality, and unethical.
- It's not my place to tell you what to do, but if you can support local brands, please do so.
- Squad Cosmetics, Fresh, and Pretty Secret are affordable and reliable brands.

1jl66kx,"a college student’s daily makeup routine (kapag sinisipag) My classes starts at 7 am and ends at 5 pm, here are the makeup products that lasts me the whole day as someone who has dry skin with olive warm undertone (slowly shifting to combi lately because of how hot the weather is lol)

maybelline lumi matte 110 (8/10)
- sobrang ganda ng lapat niya sa skin ko parang air brush kahit gaano pa kadami ilagay ko and sometimes i don’t even have to cover my blemishes with a concealer. downside lang for me is ‘yung fragrance and sometimes nagccrack siya sa side ng nose ko. 

vice co powder (10/10)
- sobrang nipis niya and it keeps the glow ng skin ko kasi may shimmers siya na hindi naman nakaka-emphasize ng textures, blurring pa siya eh. 

lilybyred blush 02 (8/10)
- perfect baby pink blush for me, long lasting naman siya sa akin even if i don’t set it with powder. may tendency lang siya mag-crease sometimes. 

issy eyeshadows (10/10)
- long lasting, hindi mahirap gamitin, and buildable. ngayon lang ako nasayahan sa eyeshadows. 

the saem tip conceal 1.25 (10/10)
- the only concealer that works on my skin. never nag-crease sa akin kahit makapal ilagay ko and hindi rin nahuhulas. high coverage kapag binabad ko sa skin pero blendable pa rin after. nag-ooxidize siya tho. 

the saem pot concealer 01 (10/10)
- almost the same review sa tip concealer nila. hindi siya nagsset agad kaya blendable siya kahit ibabad mo, never naging patchy, and it worked well on my acne marks. 

peripera blush 01 (10/10)
- lasts long on me and, surprisingly, pigmented. napaka-powdery nga lang and grabe fall out. 

grwm glam and go stix in the shade affogato (7/10)
- maganda ‘yung shade kasi hindi muddy tignan, but idk if normal na para siyang nagtutubig maybe dahil sa init. natutunaw din siya huhuhu  easy to blend and sets into a velvet finish. 

squad concealer cc0 (6/10)
- clings on to my dry patches, plus naiinis ako sa applicator and stopper kasi ang hirap hugutin kaya natalsik lagi ‘yung products everywhere. 

careline mascara (utang ng pilipinas/10)
- the only mascara na hindi nagpanda eyes sa akin and it holds the curl the WHOLE day! hindi rin clumpy pero mahirap tanggalin ㅠㅠ

romand lippies, mellow pear & nucadamia (9/10)
- hydrating enough and long lasting naman except it oxidizes into a diff shade sa akin. 

romand lip liner, kaya beige (10/10)
- i don’t mind naman na ‘di siya long lasting pero ang ganda kasi ng blurring effect niya sa line ng lips ko. not too pale, parnag mlbb lang sa akin. 

etude eyebrow pencil (4/10)
- my brow area is too oily yata for this to stay huhu nawwipe off!

dior highlighter (10/10)
- medyo bias review as it is a gift from my gf pero i’d like to note na hindi siya nakalat sa buong face ko unlike other highlighters na nahuhulas and nakalat. wet look effect, i sometimes use it as a bronzer and blush na since it doesn’t emphasize my pores naman. 

issy bi-phase setting mist (9/10)
- sagot sa dry skin ko kapag masyado na akong matagal sa airconditioned room and when napapasobra ako ng retouch ng powder. huwag lang mapapasobra ng reapply kasi nagllift ang makeup ko rito. 

unnecessary addition:

cosnori tone up cream 
- used only to mask my undertone kasi neutral leaning to cool ang founda ko hahahaha para hindi mukhang nakalutang ulo ko kasi kitang-kita shade difference ng mukha and leeg ko.

1dlhjul,"Great hydrating essence for less than 200 pesos I saw this at SM and decided to try it since i have been seeing a lot of good reviews online. This Hada Labo Hydrating Lotion costed me less than 200, but there was also a bigger size costing 600+ that was available as well (didn't buy it because I was on a tight budget).

Long story short, it made my skin very hydrating and soft in less than a week. It even softened my neck lines and improved the texture of my skin to the point that my aunt complimented on it. My face has never looked healthier and bouncier than it does now, considering that I have been staying up late studying lately. Its literally giving mochi skin. A single drop can go a long way, there's no smell of alcohol, its not sticky, and i don't have to use a thick moisturizer to retain the hydration. Its also a godsend for my oily and sensitive skin honestly, i havent had any breakouts in weeks. I have actually stopped using funda because of it.

If you want to try it, i highly recommend you incorporate it into your skincare routine as a essence of sorts. Use twice a day and apply a light moisturizer on top (use gel moisturzer if you're oily like me).

I have very oily eyelids, waterproof mascara is a must or else magpapanda eye or babagsak talaga yung lashes ko.

I even get my 10k steps in humid weather outdoors + commute without it budging. 

Tools-

Glamfix eyelash curler - mine if a few years old na hehe but it still works fine. It doesn’t have to be this curler i just find this one to fit the length of my eyes perfectly unlike the Shu Uemura one which pinches the folds of my skin.

Waterproof mascara! - important to hold the curl of your lashes throughout the day. 

What I use:

Ukiss mascara base- my favorite mascara ever. The spoolie is thin and doesn’t smudge accidentally on the hood of my eyes which can happen if your eyelashes are super curled. This is hulas proof too! I have both in black and brown. 

Maybelline Sky High mascara- okay naman I use this cos ewan nabudol yata ako? I forgot. but it works for adding volume to your eyelashes! But i find it clumps easily. Good lasting power too! 

Eyelash comb- not necessary but helpful if you find your mascara clumps too much. This also avoids panda eyes as the excess product may melt sa jinet. 

Blower- any blower with heat setting!!!

Steps:

I warm my eyelash curler with the hair dryer set in warm for about 30 seconds, i tap it against my wrist first to check for temp. 

Be cautious okay cos you might burn your eyes so please do not skip this step! 

If it’s not too hot, I position the curler almost sa root ng lashes, without pinching my skin, then I press the curler once mga 5 seconds. Then check if na curl buong lashes ko. I go with a second pass to curl yung hindi nasama na hair.

I get my mascara, remove the excess product then comb it through my lashes making sure na abot hanggang root is coated. This step makes sure that the curl gets locked in talaga and would last! Then comb it with lash comb if dikit dikit, ihiwalay, para mukhang madami ang lashes. Then add another coat if you want. 

Then I warm my curler again the same step sa susunod na lashes.

Hope this helps! ❤️❤️❤️",https://i.redd.it/2ncv0x5ob40f1.jpeg,331,32,Before/After,maybelline,international,"mascara, brow, lashes, lash, eyelash curler",,2025-05-11,Neutral
1jsnot5,"Sharing is caring! Wanted to share how I am clearing my fungal acne TLDR: Switched my hair, body and skincare to to fungal-acne safe products and my skin immediately started clearing!

I used to have such good skin pre-pandemic but because of shitty diet and weight gain, I developed this redness on my face that just won't go away. Recently, they started getting worse and even had acne all over (see before photos). I was just fed up so replaced my skincare and switched to higher end skincare the past month but the  redness and acne just won't go away. I took a photo of my skin and posted on Google Image search (try lang naman) to see what Google will say. Images of Malassezia folliculitis or Pityrosporum folliculitis cropped up and I started on a deep rabbit hole on [sezia.com](http://sezia.com) [simpleskincarescience.com](http://simpleskincarescience.com) [folliculitisscout.com](http://folliculitisscout.com) I was obsessed on looking for a simple skincare regimen and products that had all ingredients na FA-safe and available here in the PH. Some blogs kasi will say that a product is FA-safe but when I check the ingredients, it had at least more than 2 ingredients that was moderate, risky or dangerous for FA-prone skin. 

I finally ended on these 4 products after days of obsessive research: 

\- Dr. Wong's Sulfur Soap - as my daily cleanser. I lather this on clean hands and use the bubbles on my face. I don't apply the soap directly to my skin. I leave this on for 2-3 minutes (some say at least 5-10 minutes but your girl doesn't have that patience in the bathroom).

\- Dr. Sensitive Niacinamide + Salicylic Acid - as my daily moisturizer. I got the sachet version first to check if my skin will improve or react badly. It improved already on day 2 of use so I got the bigger size na. Supposedly CORSRx Niacinamide is good too but this one from Dr. Sensitive was just more available and affordable. 

\- Dr. Sensitive Sunscreen (not the tinted one!) - as my sunscreen. I am experimenting if doing away with this will make my skin better as I find that it sometimes make me itchy on certain parts. 

\- Replaced my shampoo and conditioner with this 2 in 1 Selsun Blue Shampoo-Conditioner 

I stopped wearing makeup for now except to brush my eyebrows, apply lip tint or lip balm and to put on mascara (not water proof or water resistant para easier to remove). I plan to go back to my usual makeup and skincare routine after a month of doing this skincare, hopefully no more redness, acne and itchy reactions.

1dzw7oj,"What beauty products does the stereotypical Filipino ✨IT Girl✨ use? What beauty products and trends are considered essential for the stereotypical Filipino 'IT girl'? We all know the type, that girl who keeps with the trends and maintains a well thought out sense of style. The girl in our heads we aspired to emulate. I’m curious about the trends and must-haves that define her look. 

I think for a while, around 2018, the trendy girls would wear red lip-tint and baby powder, whatever the brand, that’d be the look. Her hair would either be down, or in a scrunchie ponytail. 

However, the “IT girl” of today likely follows a clean girl aesthetic. In my opinion, she’d likely be a fan of local and Korean beauty brands (think Issy, Stokes, Detail, ChuChu, Absidy and Rom&nd, Peripera, ect)

What’s your opinion on what defines the Filipino IT girl aesthetic?

1kiw9tl,"Flower Knows Strawberry Cupid Set Been using this set for 2 weeks and I have been very impressed with the performance. Gamit ko sila daily (medyo nakakahinayang nung umpisa kasi nasira yung molding haha) and they work well for the no-make up look na fresh lang. 

- Favorite product: Liquid Blush – lasts for about 8hrs on me (with powder topper), blends easily even when using finger or brush and very natural looking; I think this is comparable in performance as RB liquid blush but a tiny bit creamier. It has very very subtle scent na amoy yung mga scented stationary pero I don’t smell it during application; kapag inamoy ko lang talaga yung product

- Lips Creams: I love the color pay off of these, kahit medyo worried ako nung una kasi parang whipped cream yung texture nila. But what I saw in the ads is exactly the same when I applied it on my lips, kahit two-toned yung lips ko, nacover pa rin nya. Since parang whipped sila, very lightweight lang sila sa lips. 

- Face Palette: This comes with 1. matte highlighter, 2. blush (the blush in Shade 01 works well as blush topper of Rum Cocoa liquid blush), 3. shimmery shadow, 4. light matte shadow, 5. glittery shadow or highlight, 6. medium matte shadow and 7. dark matte shadow; in terms of texture - super fine powder sya and I haven’t experienced any fall out so far. Very light yung shades 3 and 4 pero buildable naman, but for light warm skin parang naglalaho sila sa akin. I can use shade 6 as nose contour and 7 as winged eyeliner. I really love the glitters of shade 5, maliliit din kasi yung pagkaglitters kaya parang cute lang sya kapag tinatamaan ng lights. I can do really good douyin look with this set.

- Pressed powder: I can say that the oil control is okay (maybe 3-4 hrs). The shade complements well with my skin tone kaya it looks natural on me. I love how lightweight it feels kasi manipis din siya iapply using the included puff.

To be honest, I didn’t have high expectations sa performance because I was just sold due to the packaging haha. But that aside, definitely impressive silang lahat. The liquid blush for me is on par with Rare Beauty and the pressed powder performance is comparable with Laura Mercier (at least for the first four hours before touch up). The eyeshadows are the best from what I have in my arsenal so far (I only have Morphe and GRWM to compare with and narealize ko na sobrang powdery pala nila). I do have other lipsticks with similar smoothness in application as the lip creams but I noticed that my lips crack less when I used these vs my other lipsticks (absidy, HS Shut Up and Kiss Me).

Now, for the price point. Are they worth it? On shopee, the main set (1 Lip Cream, 1 Liquid Blush, 1 Face Palette, 1 Liquid Blush + freebies) is currently priced at ₱5.5K. If you will add 2 more Lip Creams (like I did), the total cost will be around ₱7.205 with vouchers. This will average about ₱1K+ per product, which I think is quite expensive though still cheaper than other luxury brands + very cute yung packaging.

But, if you are comfortable to use Taobao + Alipay app and buy directly from China, I was able to buy all these items + shipping for only about ₱4.5K. Almost 40% cheaper overall. (btw, the shipping fees is almost ₱1K, so nasa ₱3.5K lang talaga yung products) At that price point, I definitely think the products are great steals na. The shipping time to Philippines took 10 days and medyo mahirap lang kasi full Chinese yung Taobao app (the web version can be translated to English) but it’s a small price to pay, considering almost ₱3K less overall. 

Nga pala, iirc, the whole set (yung may kasamang mukhang doll house) is priced at ₱34K in Shopee and Lazada but in Taobao, it was only priced at about ₱13.2K (but nawala na siya sa Taobao kasi nagrelease na sila ng bagong set).

1dwn0vh,"Swatching my Lippies Collection Recently got into a lippies and thought of swatching all the lip products I’ve purchased this year!

**Rom&nd Juicy Lasting Tint- 21 Deep Sangria**

It’s a cool red that would work well with cool toned girlies. Its color is very vibrant and it could go a tad bit darker with additional layers. 

**Lancôme - 888 French Idol**

It’s a red with a pinkish tone. Formula is creamy and pigmented, one stroke is good enough for an opaque coverage. It glides comfortably on my lips without any tugging.

It also keeps my lips moisturized and never leaves a crusty residue.

**Peripera Ink Velvet - 20 Classy Plum Rose**

This could pass as a red in person but it’s a lot more pinkish when compared with the Rom&nd and Lancôme ones. 

This lasts long and leaves a stain. If moisturized lips mo before application of the product, upon application parang naka-filter yung lips mo.

**Rom&nd Juicy Lasting Tint- 23 Nucadamia**

It’s a rosy brown shade and good for daily use. It’s a cult favorite and used to be my favoritebut it doesn’t last long on my lips sadly. Good thing I found a better alternative. 

**Peripera Ink Velvet - 27 Strawberry Nude**

This is a nude pink shade, another cult favorite. I thought this shade would a good mlbb shade but it’s too pink on my lips but it’s a good shade of blush on me.

**Peripera Ink Airy Velvet - 22 Center Peach**

It’s a warm peach with a hint of pink in it. It’s not my favorite, I rarely use it because it feels a bit too warm on me. I use it as a blush instead.

**Peripera Ink Mood Glowy - 19 Mauve Chaos**

It’s a cool-tone mauve pink that dries down to a sheer pink that looks super natural on me. I love this shade a lot! 

Dami kong natanggap na compliments from using this. 

This keeps my lips moisturized even after a few reapplications! I also like its sweet smell similar to burnt sugar. 

**Peripera Ink Mood Glowy - 03 Rose in Mind**

It’s a muted fig-like rose color that is similar to the Rom&nd JLT Nucadamia. I also use this a lot!

Same lang sa Mauve Chaos, they have the same smell & texture. 

**Mac Lustreglass - Beam There, Done That**

It’s a rosy plum shade with a luminous finish. This glides smoothly on my lips too and. You could build up the color more but I prefer applying 2 swipes as I find it a bit too vibrant on me.

I’ve never tried using this outside because it felt out of place on me but making this compilation definitely made me rethink. I thinks it’s a nice plum

As all MAC products, this one smells heavenly!

**Mac Powder Kiss - Brickthrough**

It’s a dusty rose shade with a semi-matte finish. I think it could pass as my mlbb but I find it a bit too dry on my lips so I usually wear it with a lip oil on top.

1dxeitd,"A huge lesson learned from going to different Dermas. 
Disclaimer: I always get online derma consultations. Did a ftf once pero video call kami ng derma sa clinic nila🥲 long story, sorryy hahaha

Nag-start ako magpa consult wayback pandemic. My skin was ✨ GLOWING AND CLEAR AF✨ that time!! Did consultations with the famous derma in twitter. All is well that time, no acne scarring (didnt know her before🥲) and my oiliness literally was reduced!!! 

Not until everything went wrong. Di ko alam saan since i literally have the same skincare routine and products and I just broke out out of nowhere. And not just a simple breakout but cystic acne talaga. Atrophic scars kung atrophic scars (I dont pop them!!). Di ako nakapaderma agad since im broke. What I did was no products for a whole month then went back to previous routine. Went well but the scars are there.

After 2 years, I went to a derma clinic nearby for a ftf consult. But turns out I have to do a VC with doc since he's in a diff clinic. I found it sketchy lang since all medicines prescribed are their own products. Not even a label that has all the ingredients. Name lang ng product with actives. No expiry dates ++ very expensive. I remember reading an advice from Doc. Mojica na it's a red flag🥲. I asked the the woman assisting me about the products and she can't tell me anything that isn't on the label alr. She even told me na “ito po yung ingredients, mam” eh yung main active ingredient lang nasa label. Are you telling me pure salicylic/hydroquinone yan?😭 So i didnt buy muna and did a research on their clinic, pagkakita ko online, lahat ng patients na pumupunta sakanila eh same lang din ng pine-prescribe na routine. From soap to ointments.

So what I did is continue my so called skincare nalang. 6 months after, I went for an online consult, friends with my previous doc since she doesnt accept online consults anymore, she's from St. Lukes QC. It was a slow process but I can see it!!! Minimalist routine and always reassures and reminds me talaga. Wala masyadong acne scarring na naganap, i swear. Oiliness lang talaga problema ko. So i changed my sunscreen WHICH CAUSED MY NIGHTMARES AGAIN because I started breaking out!!! 

After 4 months of changing my sunscreen I decided to do a follow up sa TikTok Derma na nakita ko. I thought her clinic was nearby my loc kasi maybe I can visit ftf, but online for now since short ang budget. And here, ISTG i shouldve listened to my gut when she prescribed ISO for me without blood test, and no topicals were prescribed. Nagulat ako pagkakita ko nung prescription, all products were from her own line pala. And they are all expensive asf😭. Acne gel was 1.2k alone, moisturizer 700, and etc. I asked if maybe I can get an alternative sa pharmacies and sabi nya sa acne gel wala, so I had to pay for the acne gel and iso🥲 even tho ayoko talaga bumili ng kahit ano from her products hahahaha. After that, I messaged her anong magandang moisturizer, I sent her the options I have but I got no response. Seen lang. Baka yung assistant na yun. Also, she's not from the same city pala, im from cavite and she's in L.U so wth😭

Alam ko naman na sa ISO it gets worse before it gets better😔 pero I wish we didnt start with ISO muna if ik it was an option. My acne got worse, yes, side effect. All of them were big cystic acnes and caused deep acne scars :((. As in. Sa isang spot there are three cystic acne na lubog na because of scarring. DONT GET ME WRONG, what Iloved the most about ISO is literal na hindi na ko oily hahahaha. 2 weeks before my iso ends, i decided to start using the topicals again (skinoren, bpo) and istg it helped a lot. I stopped getting new ones and napakalma yung breakout. I know different dermas have different approached, but this is sad and honestly traumatizing. Checked her tiktok ulit, napansin ko na halos lahat ng patients nya pineprescribe nya ng ISO. Although nagsasabi naman sya na aggressive talaga approach nya. 

Now, I went back to the derma sa St. Lukes (thanks Doc at tinanggap mo pa rin ako). She didnt prescribe me iso but tret since no reason daw to take ISO. Mind you😭 my face rn is much worse kesa sa face ko prior the L.U derma :((. I wish I could turn back the time talaga!!! Yung acne gel nya pa na 1.2k diko alam kung effective ba, pero inuubos ko pa rin since sayang (i asked my current derma if san ko pwede isingit sa routine ko)

Napansin ko lang dun sa dalawang derma na may own products ay they have their own “aesthetic clinics” whereas the other two are sa hospital talaga. Pero yung pinakauna kong derma, afaik she has her own clinic na rin, idk if she offers her own products. 

Pero yun, sorry ang haba pero im just literally sad about my face since topicals cant really lessen my acne scars and they are really expensive :(( nasa tourism and hospitality industry pa man din ako🥲. Be aware sa pinapagpa-check-up-an niyo pls para hindi sayang and no regrets!!

16gozer,"Ang annoying ng mga nagrereklamo sa pricing ng Colourette This whole fiasco started with their first base skin tint. It is indeed technically more expensive compared to other locally available skin tints but I also think the quality is SO worth it. It works best for oily skin which the ""crowd favorite"" Issy Active Skin Tint was not able to give imo. Not that I'm bringing the other brand down, just saying first base worked better for most Filipino skin types considering na lagi tayong pawis sa Pilipinas. It also provides good coverage which is necessary for me as a textured and acne-prone girly. We already know other +++ in this product. Bottomline: I believe the price matches the serve. 

And now that they released new blushes, ang OA nanaman agad ng reaction. I've seen some comments saying it's too expensive ""for Colourette"" because it seems that the price is in line with BLK and Sunnies Face products. Huhhhh. Pag ibang local brands (kahit new business) ang nag-release ng slightly above average-priced beauty products, ang laging sinasabi ""you're not the target market"". Apparently this principle does not apply to Colourette 😕. Colourette is a pioneer in Filipino beauty and they've been in the business for so long. They earned the right to create these price differences over time. Aside from drying Colourtints, their recent releases are truly great products.

I hope we can stop pitting this brand down just because they have built their branding with the sense of community and not with fancy luxurious graphics. Colourette is worth their pricing.

16h72rc,"Let's Talk About: Vice Cosmetics I used to avoid Vice Co cause I found their branding so so cringe (like shades named Boom Panes and Keriboomboom lol) but honestly this is now one of my favorite local brands. Here's a mini review of everything I've tried so far:



Aura Blush Mood in Soft Mauve, Apricot Crush (11/10) - These are SO SO nice. Easy to apply and super ganda on the cheeks since it gives a nice natural flush of color. Lasts really long too!! I've commented in previous threads that I've used it during a workout, a full work day, etc and it lasts. Main con is I heard the packaging breaks easily but mine's still in tact. Highly recommend and would prolly buy the other shades if may good sale.


Wonder Woman Divine Illuminator (7/10) - I bought this since wala parin restock ng GRWM Skin Booster. This is ok, it's better than Issy's which has more obvious chunky glitters but I still prefer GRWM's which gives a more natural/undetectable glow since I use it under foundation. 


Multi Ganda Glow Blush Stick in Glow Bomb (5/10) - I find this a bit patchy and hard to apply. I use a stippling blush to diffuse it on the cheeks and tbh it kinda requires a bit of work to apply nicely. Lasts long though once it sets. I may give the regular non-shimmer ones one day but Idk not a fan of this talaga


Snap Stix in Gilded, Rosè (10/10) - Perfect for tamad days when I can't be bothered to apply eyeshadow but still wan't extra oomph on the eyes. I only got the shimmer ones since I had matte eye crayons from Sunnies already and they go well together. Lasts all day, doesn't crease on the lid. Nakakaganda siya, siz.


Perfect Kizz Lip Liner in Kizz & Tell, Peace (10/10) - We all know how great these are. I only ever use lip liner when I can't reapply my lipstick for extended periods and this DOES. NOT. BUDGE. Medyo gets ko na why this never goes on sale.


On The Daily Power Pen Liquid Eyelinet in Jet Black (8/10) - Has a nice brush and I find this easy to apply naman. It's not as budge proof as I would like since it rubs off easily (might be a me thing though since I tend to rub my eyes?!? Idk) Will probably try the gel ones in cocoa/nude next time

1lwvc8j,"Reddit Budols: beauty products you’ve bought bc of this sub / other beauty subs and your honest review on it. I wanna start a discussion / thread on this. 
I actually go to reddit for honest reviews and have found some good products on here, but also found some that are questionable 🤨 haha but i know not every high rated products here are for everyone, so include your skin type in your reviews if its a makeup product. 


I’ll start first, take note that my skin type is: - VERY oily!!. (these reviews are mostly products na mabibili lg from watsons since i live near one lol)


1.) **Ponds Hyaluron Sunscreen (Blue)**

     I’ve been using this one as my daily sunscreen for more than a year now. And i love it! Before this, i used Bioré UV aqua rich watery sunscreen and it just felt very sticky for me and my face just felt so oily after a while so i searched this sub for an affordable daily sunscreen and i saw this and it has lots of upvote and good comments so i bought this. Thanks to whoever posted abt this in this sub! 


2.) **Dr. Sensitive Blur Powder - Natural**

      I could live without this lol i mean it’s blurring for like 5-10mins and then you will oil up agad. Better to buy other powders.  


3.) **Y.O.U Noutriwear Make Up Lock Mist**

This made me so oily throughout the day. did NOT lock my makeup at all and made my base patch up and parang nagbalat balat. :/

4.) **BLK Skintint - sand shade**

I actually get compliments from my roomie when i wear this, esp pag bagong lapat. She says my skin looks fresh daw. So this is a good base for me! But i dont like the applicator packaging, i use my hands to apply this. But it doesnt really stay in my face for a whole day. 


5.) **SOLA foundation primer- Light Beige**

I actually saw bad reviews abt this here like its a good base daw BUT will make you breakout after. But i also saw na on sale sya sa 7/11 nung binili ko so i went for it LOL Im prolly one of the few na hindi nagbreak out while using this which made me feel lucky bc its coverage is 🤌🏼🤌🏼🤌🏼!!!!  And its does NOT BUDGE !! I know bc this is the tint i use when i go on hikes and when i visit construction sites hahhaha. pro-tip: i also saw on other beauty sub na you can mix your moisturizer with your skin tint. and that hack is so good with sola esp if gsto mo mas smooth yung pag apply. 


6.) **Dazzle Me Setting Spray- Matte Fix**
I saw that s*xproof post in this sub and went to watsons straight away 💀 i like that it makes my face matte (dont like dewy skin on my self bc im already oily, its just adds up extra unnecessary shine on my face). Anyways, somehow, mas okay sya sa Y.O.U noutriwear spray in terms of longevity but this not really smudge-proof as the post said sure ako pag na-on na yung ilaw,makikita nya yung smudge ng foundation sa pillows na gnamit nila 😭 but for a cheap setting spray? pwede naman na. i used it on my baguio trip actually and it stayed on but just bc malamig don haha ibang usapan na sguro pag sobrang init. 


So thats it muna, i think i forgot to include other products but i will add on comments if i remember.

hvola4,"Skin Care basics and the shams I wanted to share some tips and knowledge in skincare since a lot of the same questions are being asked in most posts here. I am not a doctor. this is all based from experience, knowledge, research, advice from dermatologist and another great sub skincareaddiction. Remember skin care is a personal journey (trust me! i have a lot of trial and errors too)

Basic Routine:

AM
- cleanse
- moisturizer
- Sunscreen

PM
- cleanse
- treat
- moisturizer

From this, you can add items to suit your personal skin care needs. For example.

Oily Skin

AM
- Cleanse
- Anti redness Toner
- Spot treat with BHA
- Oil free, gel type moisturizer
- Non greasy sunscreen

PM
- double cleanse
- Calming Toner
- BHA
- Niacinimide
- Moisturizer 

For dry skin, maybe add more (7x if u like lol) toner or a heavier moisturizer, etc.

You dont need to put a lot, start with the basic routine then add one item at a time so you know what works, what your skin doesn’t like. Everyone’s skin is different. For example, silicones are okay for some, for some it causes irritation and clogged pores. Some are okay with zinc, some aren’t. Always patch test first and YMMV. Always look for the science  behind it thus its important to research and check reviews. The cosmetic/skincare industry will try to sell you a lot of stuff.

Summary of my other thoughts (references down below)
- Always wear Suncreen, indoors, outdoors, cloudy day. As long as there is light (UV index of more than 1), there is UVA, blue light, UVB etc.
- alcohol is a no-no (alcohol, alcohol denat, SD alcohol)
- fatty alcohols are good (cetyl, stearyl, cetearyl alcohol)
- perfume causes irritation
- Natural doesnt always mean no irritation
- Double cleanse what? 1st cleanser (oil/balm) to remove make up/sunscreen, 2nd cleanser (at correct PH) is the gel/foam/liquidy type. Remove dirt, make up, spf. Squeaky clean is not the goal. Do not over cleanse. Strip in the bedroom not your moisture.
- A broken moisture/skin barrier causes skin problem for all skin types (even oily ones)
- Hydrating your skin is different from moisturizing. (Multi molecular weight) Hyaluronic acid, glycerin are popular plumping/hydrating ingredient. Although some moisturizers can be hydrating.
- They talk about toner as being connected to Ph level or whatever, toning is just a hydrating step, dont complicate it.
- Dont over exfoliate, add one chemical exfoliant at a time (either BHA, AHA, PHA, etc). Once your skin gets acclimated then use all the acids, LoL kidding. Be nice to your skin and say no to physical exfoliation (microbeads). 😁
- Why do they like to exfoliate? Its helps with hyperpigmentation, acne scars and has brightening effect (other notable ingredients vitamin c, niacinimide)
- Retinol and vitamin C are tricky yet important ingredients. Vitamin C is unstable. Skin care brands often are misleading about Retinol components. 
- Vitamin C easily oxidizes, once you open the bottle or been sitting on a shelf of a long time, exposed to sun and other elements. Its just *poof* a waste, even if its marketed as stable with Ferulic acid, etc. that’s why the L-Ascorbic Acid powder is popular (although not easy to use) but is the most effective version out there. There are other vit c products (cheap or expensive) that are said to be effective and hyped by many, YMMV.
- most Retinol products are a sham. Just use retin-A or tretinoin (for efficacy) if you’re worried about wrinkles.
- Some noteworthy retinol products: Dermatica, Curology, Adapalene, Diffirin, Paula’s Choice 1% Retinol, Avene RetrinAI
- Collagen supplements gets metabolized in your stomach before it reaches (if any left) your skin. So you can’t drink beautiful skin but always drink water not sugar, dairy.
- Retinol, Niacinimide, Vit C are the only ingredients  that has proven to address ‘mature’ skin, wrinkles. Note i didnt use ‘anti aging’ ‘reverse time’ ‘freeze time’ ‘rejuvenate’ ‘detox’ etc LoL those are marketing cliches.
- Peptides at most are moisturizing. The only science backed up peptide is the one found in TO Buffet + Copper Peptides and NIOD CAIS2
- Apply skin care beginning with lightest to heaviest; liquid type to cream, last is oil.

Popular youtube beauty/skincare vloggers:
Hyram, James Welsh, gothamista, Liah Yoo, etc. They all can teach you something or two but they are not doctors/experts/chemist. Sometimes they agree on certain products, sometimes they dont. But they push products (does gothamista really use all of those (tons and tons) products?) I bet she uses NIOD CAIS2 consistently though, just a guess. Liah really looks young though (genes?). They are fun to watch too.

For example, Krave Beauty Matcha is a holy grail for James Welsh but ‘its okay’ for Hyram. Gothamista likes ‘the face shop oil cleanser’ but I seriously cant get over the perfume. But they all like (not sure about Liah) Klairs Soft Airy UV essence and Purito centella unscented sunscreen. Liah does not like alcohol but now, Krave Beet the Sun Sunscreen has alcohol.

Read up on science:
- Thebeautybrains.com
- The beauty brains podcast hosted by a cosmetic chemist
- Lab muffin - written and vlogged by a chemist
- Beautypedia ingredient list
- Cosmetic Cop - Paula Begoun

Read, cross check, find references

Finally, big and expensive clinics will ask their dermatologist / aestheticians to sell products. Be aware. Find a good, honest, within your budget dermatologist. Get to know them, be friends with them. He/She can provide you a lot of insights and help, even free stuff.

*if i missed something, got something wrong and/or additional thoughts, please please do make a comment and let me know. Thanks!

1fi5vf5,"Finished my first bullet lipstick! My Everest!

I started my project pan in March 2024 and this lipstick, which I’ve had since pre-pandemic (I know it has been that loooong, wag niyo na kong i-call out about expiration eme eme, it still glides well, no smell, di nangati lips ko, etc. It expires when I say it’s expired chzzz 😆), is the only thing that I promised myself that I will fully finish before the year ends. And today, finally, umabot na ko sa part na nakakaskas na ng lips ko ung container! I’ll still use it until kaya ko haha!

I remember this was my first MLBB before MLBB became a thing, my oldest lipstick to date. 

It took some time to finish it since I have like 3-4 lipsticks on my makeup kit, bumilis lang ang pag-pan when I remove all my other lipsticks so I don’t have an option. If there’s one thing I’ve learned in this process is that lipsticks take a loooong time to finish, so ngayon, I will think about how long it took me para maubos to before buying any lipstick again. 

For reference, I have around 20+ lipsticks in my collection, some of which are just a variation of each other jusko.

1h3gqhm,"Products I’ll repurchase  As a student and a commuter, here are the  reasons why I think these items are worth the money:

1.) Ever Bilena Blush (Fever Dream)
- I saw it first sa friend ko, we attended an outdoor event around 1 pm-6 pm and 'yung blush niya lang ang nag-stay. I tried it, and the longevity is so real! I personally don't have to retouch, I sometimes wear it alone or to set my liquid blush. It blends well, the blush looks like a natural flush on the cheeks. 

2.) Teviant Deity Dust (Office Hour)
- This one is very convenient to bring especially since I'm someone who travels from province to MNL once a week. It's pretty buildable, easy to blend, and lays seamless. Though this one I do have to retouch at least once while I'm at MNL. My other issue is that both the blush and the contour have shimmers, but it's not too visible sa contour once applied.

3.) Colourette's First (Oslob) and Second (Lazi) base
- Both of these take the crown! My first base is actually my second tube na as I'm truly impressed how long lasting it is, plus the coverage helps me lessen the effort of spot concealing (which I appreciate as a student so I could put more time into sleeping lol). The longest I've worn this is at least 12 hours max, no hulas talaga. As for the second base, I love the coverage and longevity naman pero I had a hard time making this work especially sa under eyes ko because this creases so BADLY. So double the effort talaga sa pagha-hydrate.

4.) Biya brow pen
- This one surprised me. It's so cheap so I didn't really have a lot of expectations, but it's actually long lasting. I tried to draw strokes din on the back of my hand and then I rubbed it harshly pero hindi siya nag-fade. Just expect lang na nag-bbleed siya kapag napa-kapal na strokes mo.

5.) Issy Setting Spray
- I’m so happy with this one because I really had a hard time searching for a good setting spray. I tried Zeesea and GRWM, but they didn’t really work well : (. Ang ganda ng hold niya! Plus points pa ‘yung once matuyo na ‘yung mist, parang may airbrushed effect. Though hindi siya matte finish, it leaves a bit of glow. 

6.) Chuchu loose powder
- The most random purchase I’ve done, but I ended up appreciating it. It has a bit of blurring effect and I also use this to retouch my face, thankfully I didn’t experience creasing dito kasi I experienced some powder na nagko-cause ng creasing. Cheap ko lang din ‘to nakuha. 

7.) Vice cosmetics lip liner (Last Kizz)
- Medyo long lasting if you don’t eat oily foods and it glides easily naman. I only bought it because I love the shade and B1T1. 

8.) Careline mascara, liquid blush, and lip oil. (+ EB tinted lip balm)
- For the mascara, it’s lasts me the whole day, doesn’t give me panda eyes, and it’s amazingly lengthening! The liquid blush isn’t patchy on my cheeks, I don’t frequently use liquid blushes kasi they are so patchy on my cheeks and hindi sila kumakapit on some spots. I can’t really comment sa longevity niya because I always set it with the EB blush. Lastly, the lip oil. If you struggle with dry and cracking lips like me, this one is perfect! It’s not sheer, not heavy, not sticky, and it doesn’t leave any tint, but it’s hydrating naman pero mas hydrating pa rin ‘yung lip balm ng EB, I just don’t have it rn so I wasn’t able to include it sa pic pero that one I’ve emptied a tube na and purchased a new one.

1douci1,"Issy x Slo Lopez Surreal Palette Swatches + First Impressions This is the first time in a long time that I got incredibly excited for a local brand’s launch! 🤩

Swatches from left to right, top to bottom row:
- Delirium, Shapeshift, Metamorphosis, Chameleon
- Lurex, Fool’s Gold, Patina, Alloy
- Enamour, Monarch, Absinthe, Electronica

All of these feel smooth and thin when swatched but delivers a high shine look. Personally, the formula is comparable to Oden’s Eye i.e. smooth and thin but impactful glimmery shadows.

The first row swatched do not have any base color and are purely shimmers, perfect for eyeshadow toppers for a black base. The second row swatched feels foily and looks like liquid metal when packed. The third row are standard shimmers.

My favorites at the moment are:
- Metamorphosis — perfect lilac to light teal duochrome it is so pretty!!!!
- Fool’s Gold — perfect neutral taupe and a beautiful one and done
- Delirium — white to pink duochrome reminiscent of something from Pat McGrath’s Mothership VII: Divine Rose
- Patina — if you want a neutral duochrome, it shifts from a reddish brown to a greenish taupe idek if that makes sense but it’s so unique!! Like if you want a fun neutral this is it!
- Absinthe — green with a dark base it’s so edgy!
- Electronica — the perfect cobalt blue which reminds me of that one blue shade in Pat McGrath’s Mothership I: Subliminal

I genuinely appreciate how everyone is so positive and polite when dealing with fellow users. I haven’t really seen snarky comments, just fellow kikay people helping each other out. When people have follow-up questions, other users are generous with input. It’s really such a nice and positive sub where people help others discover new products or tips that make us feel more confident. 🥹

That said, what is your favorite budol/discovery/tip/recommendation because of this sub and why? It can be a product/service/practice/etc.?

15w0zxv,"Battle of the setting sprays Here's my reco for fixing sprays as a oily dehydrated girly in a hot & humid country right at the equator (I stay in SG where it gets more humid and hot than in PH). I also tend to finish 1 bottle of a 100ml Setting Spray in a month.

1 - One Size On 'Til Dawn Setting Spray

Thoughts: Gusto nyo ba ng plakado from day to night? Yung sa akin the other way around bec I wore this from 6pm - 6am and been through eating dinner, chill na inom, partying at Zouk, 20mins of walking to look for an after party hawker, eating a hot bowl of hor fun and my makeup was still on. Nothing budged even if I did sweat throughout the walking, jumping and dancing. If you need something for special occasions that you know you'll be beat up but you want your makeup na plakado pa rin, this is it! I will repurchase. 

Application: Mac fix+ after liquid & creams and O/S setting spray after powders


2 - CT Airbrush Flawless Setting Spray

Thoughts: Upon application, parang nasusuck yung hydration sa face ko which has its pros and cons. Pros for oily skin type is that the oiliness won't peak thru until 8hrs later but if you're a dry skin type hooman, use it with caution kasi baka magcrusty yung makeup nyo especially if you'll be using powders. No qualms about this product except for its price but I use it as well on occasions that I want a plakado makeup look and I know that I'll be out for a while. I will repurchase. 

Application: CT setting spray after liquid & creams then final spray after powders


3 - Makeup Forever Mist & Fix Matte

Thoughts: This is the setting spray I brought with me in Bali for 9 days and it was giving. It's not like the CT spray na parang nasuck yung every drop ng hydration sa face mo. My makeup was still great even if I walked for the whole day in Ubud (weather was sunny but I didn't sweat bec of the cool breeze) and Seminyak (sunny but cool breeze pa rin but I did sweat a bit). Whenever I sweat and use a paper towel, there's transfer but not in an alarming way. Whenever I'm about to take my makeup off, I'm amazed how my makeup was still on. I will need to try this on SG weather tho which is comparable with PH's. I will repurchase. 

Application: Makeup Forever setting spray after liquid & creams then final spray after powders


4 - Sephora Makeup Setting Spray

Thoughts: If you're on a budget and you need an everyday setting spray, this is it! Not sure why this is slept on but I trust this with my 9am-6pm and my 40hr commute back and forth (total of 1.2hrs) via train with a bit of walking to the train stn and my office. I really recommend this for everyday. It doesn't suck out the hydration but makes my makeup on fleek. I will repurchase. 

Application: Sephora setting spray after liquid & creams then final spray after powders


5 - Urban Decay All Nighter (not in photo)

Thoughts: Been repurchasing this over the years since it was the OG setting spray but a lot of better setting sprays have been released in the market. It's weird because it makes my makeup a bit crusty even if it doesn't suck the hyrdration after application. My makeup is ok but I get oily after the 5th hr mark with this one. My eyeshadow also gets into my lines. This is only a so-so and would not repurchase since I already have other better setting sprays. 

Application: UD setting spray after liquid & creams then final spray after powders


6 - GRWM Lifeproof Fixing Spray Matte

Thoughts: Idk why I kept on trying to make this work. I bought 4 bottles of the bigger size when I was back in PH because I thought I will save some moolah. But after 3hrs, my makeup gets too oily na. By lunch time, I need to touch up with blotting paper and powder. Tried this with every technique I could think of but this isn't for me. At first, I thought it was a good setting spray for everyday that I reco it in this subreddit but I think I was delulu bec I really want to support PH made products. I hope they'll develop a better setting spray that can go thru fire & ice. lol. I won't repurchase anymore bec it did nothing to keep my makeup on and my oil on bay. 4 bottles of trying it out is enough I guess until they improve the formula.

Application: GRWM setting spray after liquid & creams then final spray after powders

Want to try: Kryolan & Skindinavia

Won't try: Zeesea

1cpgkc1,"I tried a skin analysis machine and here's what i found out about my skin For context: when i was younger, i had oily skin. I'm now in my 30s and my current skin condition is a combination of oily and dry. I began religiously taking care of my skin when I was 15. I don't have PCOS, I eat clean and sleep well.

I've never had cystic acne however, i always get atleast 1 pimple everytime i get my period. My skin tends to scar and develop hyperpigmentation easily so it has always been a challenge for me to manage the post acne pigmentation (mildly seen in the first quadrant).

If i remember correctly, the top right quadrant shows my sun damage level, bottom left shows the sensitive areas of my face and the bottom right shows both the deep and shallow pigmentations i have (...parang ang dami pala 🥲)

I've always relied on my on-the-clock-updated skin care routine, however, it's taking more time than expected for me to see improvements so i decided to finally visit a doctor for possible treatments.

For reference this analysis was done on a machine called OPATRA. On the naked eye my skin has some hyperpigmentation (see 2nd photo), but i only got to learn the extent of it's condition after having it analyzed. After years of religious use of sunscreen and skin care my skin's concerns, in order are:

🚩 premature wrinkling (low: possible because i because using retinoids and SKII, so im not surprised about this)

🚩🚩 dryness (high: on my cheeks, my skin feels very dry but on my nose, my skin is oily. I've been using moisturizers however, i think the dryness is due to me staying in airconditioned rooms daily)

🚩🚩 pore care and texture (high: i told naman the doctor na both my parents have prominent pores na talaga, but on my end i have to maintain lang on my making sure they're not clogged and remain hydrated...so connected parin siya sa issue ng dryness somewhat)

🚩🚩🚩 hyperpigmentation (very high 😭, so like in the naked eye, hindi naman malala, but in the machine, super daming ""upcoming"" sun spots, deep pigments and freckles, plus i really have to work on the spots left from my previous pimples 

ANYWAY, there's a skin grade and if i remember correctly 60-70 percentile yung skin ko 😭 the doctor said my skin looks nice naman daw but di ko tanggap na after all my efforts through the years, medyo sablay parin pala.

I'm glad i consulted with a doctor, and i found that my experience with the machine has been very helpful. Sa kaka focus ko wag magka wrinkles, di ko masyado natutukan yung hyperpigmentation and dryness.

I'm going to try some treatments na specifically for those concerns. I'm planning to retake the skin analysis and see if there's any change sa skin ko!

p.s. i already know that glycolic acid, niacinamide, sunflower oil etc can help with hyperpigmentation...been there done that, but i've decided na to try clinic treatments na din just to supplement what im already doing for faster results. 🤍",https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1cpgkc1,291,96,Discussion,mac,international,"moisturizer, moisturizers",,2024-05-11,Neutral
1k1ch7p,"Chemist's Review: Brilliant Skin Essentials SunProfessional Sunscreen with Orgasol Caresse Panibagong sunscreen naman ang irereview ko. Ito ay yung SunProfessional Sunscreen with Orgasol Caresse ng Brilliant Skin Essentials. Yung white ang binili ko, since hindi ako gumagamit ng tinted sunscreens for personal use. Na-curious ako sa sunscreen na ito kasi ito yung first time kong makakita ng product kung saan hindi active ingredient ang main focus. Perfect chance din ito para magkaroon ako ng idea sa performance ng Orgasol Caresse na raw material, na di ko na kinakailangang i-source out yung mismong material at ipadala sa lab. For context, ang Orgasol Caresse kasi ay isang spheroidal powder na may oil-absorption capacity at nakakapagbigay ng powdery finish, lalo na sa mga products kagaya ng sunscreen (more on this later sa ingredients portion). Naubos ko na itong nabili ko, kaya naisipan ko na ding gawan ito ng review. 

Unang kapansin-pansin sa product na ito ay yung primary packaging nitong bote na hugis itlog. Infairness sa brand, pina IPO pa nila ito, at nakita ko mismo sa IG nung brand owner yung specs at design ng boteng ito. Magandang to laban sa counterfeiting, since laganap to ngayon both sa local at international brands. Maganda din ang pagkakaprint ng text sa bote, hindi nag-i-smudge kahit basa ang kamay ng tubig, pawis, or nung mismong product. 

Ngayon naman, sa actual use. Itong sunscreen na ito ay isang opaque white na gel cream, na hindi ganoon kadaling mag-break down when in contact sa daliri o kamay. For context, may mga nasubukan na akong sunscreen na upon contact sa skin e nag-be-break na agad yung emulsion. Ito kadalasan yung sinasabi nung mga users na nagiging matubig or runny yung sunscreen kapag ginagamit nila. Scented itong sunscreen ba ito, pero hindi ganoon kalakas (for me) na tipong nakakasura. Sakto lang para ma-mask yung odor ng base formula. 

Madaling i-blend itong sunscreen na ito sa balat, and sa ilang saglit lang e nagseset na ito kaagad. Wala akong white cast na na-observe dito nung ginagamit ko. Aside sa blendability at absence ng white cast, may na-appreciate ako dito sa product na ito. May cooling effect sa balat, sakto sa mainit na panahon natin. Yung cooling effect nito ay hindi ganun katindi to the point na may stinging, subtle cooling effect lang. Kapag natuyo at nagset na sa balat itong sunscreen, dun ko naramdaman yung effect ng Orgasol Caresse na powdery feel nung hinaplos ko yung face ko. Matte ang naging finish nito sa akin, so in my opinion, ok to sa mga oily to combination skin na users. Wala din akong na-observe na pilling sa duration ng paggamit ko nitong sunscreen. Wala din akong naramdaman na stinging o hapdi sa balat nung ginagamit ko ito. 

Tumungo naman tayo sa ingredients. Ito ang ingredient list:

Water, Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate, Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane, Octocrylene, Butylene Glycol, Lecithin, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Nylon-6/12, Polyacrylamide, C13-15 Isoparaffin, Laureth-7, Titanium Dioxide, Dimethicone, Green Tea (Camellia Sinensis) Leaf Extract, Glycerin, Cucumber (Cucumis Sativus) Fruit Extract, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexylglycerin, Sunflower (Helianthus Annuus) Seed Oil, Aloe Vera (Aloe Barbadensis) Leaf Extract, Fragrance, Menthyl Lactate, Allantoin, Disodium EDTA

May apat na UV filters itong sunscreen na ito:

Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate (UVB) 
Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane (UVA) 
Octocrylene (UVB) 
Titanium Dioxide (UVB) 

May slight concern lang ako sa titanium dioxide na ginamit. Sunscreen-grade na titanium dioxide is usually coated with either aluminum hydroxide or silica. Mahalaga ang coating na yan for titanium dioxide dahil pinipigil ng mga coating na ito ang formation ng reactive oxygen species (ROS) kapag tinamaan ng UV ang Titanium Dioxide. Kahit coating yan, dapat isama pa din yan sa ingredient list. 
For more information sa function ng aluminum hydroxide, pakitingnan na lang sa link below:
https://incidecoder.com/ingredients/aluminum-hydroxide
Para naman sa silica,  please see link below:
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0925838810020128

Ok naman ang preservative system, since Phenoxyethanol at Ethylhexylglycerin ang ginamit, common preservative system na ginagamit ng mga brands na averse sa parabens. 

Tingnan naman natin yung Nylon-6/12. Yan yung INCI name ng Orgasol Caresse. Yan ung nagbibigay nung mga skinfeel benefit at oil-control dito sa sunscreen na ito. Comparable itong ingredient na ito sa Silica at sa Polymethylsilsesquioxane (PMSQ), na kapareho nitong nagbibigay ng powdery after feel at oil-control benefit. 

Another noteworthy na ingredient sa sunscreen na ito ay yung Menthyl Lactate. Ito yung nagbibigay sa sunscreen na ito ng subtle cooling effect sa skin during use. Related ito sa Menthol, ang kadalasang ginagamit na ingredient for cooling benefit. 

Ang next comment ko sa ingredients nitong product na ito ay para sa mga cosmetic chemist at regulatory personnel na in-charge sa paggawa at pag-check ng IL. Sa product na ito, hindi na-take into consideration yung % composition nung mga raw materials na existing as blends or premixes. For example, sa UV filter, ang ginamit na raw material dito is SUNCAT MTA, isang raw material premix. Ang composition nitong raw material blend na ito ay yung first 6 ingredients na makikita nyo sa IL nitong product na ito. Kung ite-take into account yung % ng each component ng SUNCAT MTA, hindi dapat magkakatabi yung anim na yan, meron jan na dapat nasa ibabang part ng IL. This is the same din sa emulsifier system at preservative system na ginamit dito, hindi advisable na magkakatabi yan, since premix yung ginamit. Ngayon, bakit ko ito pinuna? Dahil pinapadali nito ang paggaya sa product nyo ng mga competitors nyo. So para dun sa brand, kung ayaw nyo magaya kaagad ng iba yung product nyo, please consider taking into account yung % composition nung mga mixture ingredients nyo para mapwesto ng maayos sa IL. 

Punta naman tayo sa product claims. Simple at straight forward ng claims nitong product na ito, base sa label. 
1. With Orgasol Caresse
2. Broad Spectrum SPF 50 PA++++ UVA-UVB Protection

Claim #1, napatunayan na natin yan sa ingredient list, Orgasol Caresse = Nylon-6/12.

Claim #2, hindi ko alam kung nai-post na ba ng brand owner sa kanyang soc med yung SPF Test report. Yung brand owner na makakasagot nito. 

May isang bagay lang akong napansin sa box nito. Hindi nakalagay yung mandatory warning statement, according sa ASEAN Sunscreen Labeling Guideline:
Do not stay too long in the sun, even while using a sunscreen product. 
Dapat lang talaga na ilagay ito sa label ng mga sunscreen product dahil madalas na nakakalimutan ng mga consumer na hindi advisable na magbabad sa ilalim ng sikat ng araw kahit pa na naka sunscreen. Once na mahulas yang sunscreen na gamit mo, masusunog at masusunog ang balat mo jan. 

Final words regarding this sunscreen:
Aside dun sa mga comments ko regarding sa improvement ng ingredient list, absence ng mandatory warning statement, pati na sa non-inclusion ng ginamit na coating agents para sa titanium dioxide sa IL, ok naman itong sunscreen na ito overall. Good aesthetics, good formula, straight forward product claims na wala ng kuskos balungos. 

Ayun lang, maraming salamat sa pagbabasa ng review na ito.

1flk6fv,"Shiseido synchro skin self refreshing foundation REVIEW 
I recently posted about my Japan haul, which was gifted to me by my brother and his wife. As the title suggests, this post is all about my thoughts on the Shiseido Synchro Skin Self-Refreshing Foundation.

And OH. MY. GOSH.

It’s so stunning, I keep going to the restroom just to check myself out!

I first heard about this foundation when I watched The Lipstick Lesbians on IG during her matte foundation showdown. It came down to this or Pat McGrath’s foundation, but she chose the latter. For reasons unknown, I was more drawn to Shiseido than Pat McGrath. So, when my brother went to Japan, I asked him to grab it for me.

Since there isn’t a Shiseido makeup line at my nearby Sephora, I guessed my shade and picked 320 Pine for medium neutral. I think it’s a bit lighter than my actual tone. For reference, I have combination oily skin with a medium neutral undertone.

Maybe I didn’t let my skincare set long enough before applying, because when I first put it on my nose, it became cakey and accentuated my pores. So, I wiped the area with baby wipes (it was all I had on hand) and buffed the spot with the leftover foundation on my brush. The result? 👌. I finished the rest of my makeup as usual and set it with Charlotte Tilbury setting spray and Skindinavia finishing spray for longevity.

The first selfie was taken right after application, and the second was 9 hours later. I didn’t touch up with powder, only blotted my nose lightly ONCE, and I still looked like I had just applied my makeup. It even looked better as the day went on!

Here’s what Shiseido says about the foundation:

“A long-wear, climate-adaptive foundation that refreshes non-stop and protects the skin from environmental aggressors like UV rays, blue light, dryness, and pollution for a 24-hour flawless finish.* ActiveForce+™ Technology synchronizes with skin, resisting heat, humidity, oil, and movement with weightless comfort. Skin looks and feels fresh all day with medium-to-full, buildable coverage and a semi-matte finish. - For all skin types - Medium-to-full, buildable coverage - Natural, semi-matte finish - SPF30 - 24-hour wear* - All-day hydration**”

All of the above is TRUE! Hands down, the best foundation I’ve tried—better than my Dior Forever, Lancôme Ultra Teint, and Estée Lauder Double Wear. 


The rest of my makeup was my usual routine, but I did try out my Suqqu blush for the first time. Since I have combination oily skin and blush tends to fade quickly on me, I applied my Makeup Forever cream blush first, then set it with the Suqqu blush.

I’m not sure if it’s the foundation or the blush itself, but it didn’t budge! I was in awe. Honestly, I don’t want to sound dramatic, but I gasped every time I caught my reflection because my makeup looked as flawless as when I first applied it. Andami kong selfie tbh 😅

*All products are bought from Japan and gifted to me (except the makeup forever blush palette). I do not know where to buy it in the Philippines, sorry. And I didn’t try to see if it’s humid weather and commute-proof. * 


And lest I forget, I also did try for the first time my Lunasol lippie. I’ve never tried the YSL glazed lipstick but I would assume is kinda the same. Shiny, moisturizing, long-lasting, and with excellent color payoff.

1h2zfyn,"I feel like I won a jackpot 😂 I feel like I won a jackpot 😂

I wanted to buy a few things for myself and decided to do a mini pasabuy during the Detail/Squad Cosmetics Clearance Sale. 

I went there (Nov. 29) and arrived at around 10:46 am. There was no line and I was able to get inside without waiting. I started to look for the pasabuy products first before mine. By the time I got there, some of the shades for some products are sold out already but I still managed to get good ones. And as I was looking for products and shades, I tried to look at the boxes below the tables and I randomly found Detail’s Make-Lash mascara! Ive heard good reviews about this and it’s currently sold out everywhere which is why I was so ecstatic when I got it. I cant wait to try it! I also got Detail’s Power lip which is B1T1 for the price of ₱399/pair. I also got some Glass stain for B1T1 which is ₱199/pair. I already tried the glass stain before and I remember liking it so I got it again. I think they restock everyday and stocks vary each day. I asked one staff about a product and he said that it will be available tomorrow. So if you have the time and energy, I guess you can go there on multiple days until the end of the sale. 

I was done by 2 pm and it’s really exhausting to go around especially with the heat but it was a fun experience, nonetheless. The total damage was around 6k!",https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1h2zfyn,282,65,Hauls,belo,local,"mascara, lash",,2024-11-29,Negative
1ghsnq1,"Review of the Charlotte Tillbury Powder  As someone who doesn’t like splurging on high-end products and tries to justify spending on drugstore “dupes,” the Charlotte powder was my sole motivation to get rid of this mindset.

Before diving in to my review, let’s take a look at the other 2 glorified “dupes” on Tiktok.
1. Sunnies - This is great for everyday (and if you KNOW you won’t sweat). The coverage is super sheer and the mattifying power is okay, but the oil control is just not that good (which sadly is normalized in the PH beauty landscape). Not bulky but I don’t like bringing this with me because the formula just isn’t that good.
2. Absidy - This is amazing if you want to look flawless when you take pictures or videos because it’s medium to high coverage, but the oil control is mediocre (but a tad better compared to Sunnies’). Still, this is my go-to if I’m not going to an important event but still want to get that high-coverage look. This tends to cake btw. A bit bulky, but it’s fine because it has a puff.
3. Charlotte - I just found my holy grail. This is so freaking amazing that it gives the right amount of coverage (good for flash photography) without drowning you in powder. As I’m an oily-skinned girl, when I blot after 4-6 hours, the oil pick-up is minimal compared to if I had used the aforementioned 2 products. It doesn’t have a puff, but I’d gladly bring this with me just because *it’s just right*. The pick up of powder if you use a puff is also amazing, I dab it slightly lang and swipe and ang dami agad, with little to no fallout. Siguro the con is you have to build it up, kasi with any powder naman, baka mag cake if damihan mo in one go.

For those who will ask, this was a gift lang to me. I think my bf bought it from a reseller on Instagram or Facebook for around 2k.

So guys, save up for this nalang! Buy nice or buy twice/thrice 😉",https://i.redd.it/zcibz3mhigyd1.jpeg,282,123,Review,sunnies,local,"powder, lash",tiktok,2024-11-02,Positive

1hyrx8a,"Budget Friendly Moisturizer I Tried Last 2024 by a very oily and acne prone skin type

Product: Luxe Organix Cica Soothing Gel
Price: ₱129/100mL
Gel consistency. I tried it for a month, even repurchased another 100ml pero di ko na inubos kasi for some reason, it gave me fungal acnes and it's not hydrating enough for me kahit 3 layers.

Product: Celeteque Moisturizer 
Price: ₱280/100mL (usually on sale for 252)
Gel consistency. OG basic moisturizer for me since highschool. I only stopped using this when I started getting fungal acnes for some reason. It's enough for basic hydration para sakin ng at most 2 layers.

Product: Hyaloo Aqua Plus Deep Hydrating Gel
Price: ₱395/200mL (usually on sale for 375)
Gel consistency. At first walang reaction skin ko pero after 1 week of using I developed an irritation. Used it in the morning, pag-uwi ko may maliliit na pimples na mukha ko. I gave it the benefit of the doubt pa after returning from province, I tried it again to make sure if ito ba cause, pagbalik ko sa bahay meron na maliliit na acne yong kadiri tignan na maliliit tapos tabi tabi. I had to get an acne facial the next day to dry it out.

Product: Human Nature Hyaluronic Acid Gel
Price: ₱250/50mL (on sale for 237)
Slightly creamy and runny consistency. Yes, it's moisturizing for me, pero idk ha 2 sa pea size amount lang ina-apply ko pero ang greasy ng feeling sa mukha ko and I don't like it. May mild fragrance pero I don't mind it, it's the greasy feeling for me that's a no.

Product: Ellana Stay Fresh Moisturizer
Price: ₱399/60g (usually on sale for 279)
Watery na creamy consistency but it's not runny. Decent oil control, not moisturizing tho. It didn't cause a breakout. I'll settle for this na siguro as morning moisturizer before sunscreen kasi di ako nagbrebreak out nor cause fungal acnes. Face feels matte after it dried down.

Product: Aveeno Daily Moisturizing Lotion
Price: ₱224/71mL
Lotion consistency. I use this on my face if it really feels dry and it's moisturizing naman talaga kahit 1 layer lang, minsan if trip ko 2 layer haha really helps. I can't really use this as a night moisturizer since it's heavy on a normal oily skin condition ko.",https://i.redd.it/vdvhif9rwbce1.jpeg,279,99,Review,ellana,local,moisturizer,,2025-01-11,Neutral
1ls2ql9,"Vice cosmetics not restocking Does anyone else find it frustrating how they keep releasing new products before restocking all their old products first? I just saw their new ad for the matter blush kasi hahaha

I loved some of their old products (blurfecting tint, endlezz concealer, aura blush), but they've either reformulated it or is no longer restocked. Then, there's their viral powder. I just find it odd that it's taking them so long to restock when the packaging was literally the only issue with it. I wouldn't be surprised if they end up reformulating it since that seems to happen whenever they rerelease an old product with new packaging

I am sure we all wanna know what products other swore by and what they don't like. 


This will be interesting right now especially PH has a very humid and scorching hot weather and we are looking products that could withstand these conditions. I hope many of us could participate~


KISS - the products you swore by; something that you're obsessed with


MARRY - those you will forever repurchace, refill, will always get no matter what


KILL - just ""NOPE""


Of course, I will go first.


• KISS - DIOR Backstage Face Palette - Not a highlight girlie here but it gives me life and doesn't look chunky at all. May be obvious on the face (ofc) but the finish is very fine and gives you that overall glow and highlight when light hits on the high point of your face. Very different from my other highlighters. Blends with my oily face for some reason.


• MARRY-  Rare Beauty Lip Oils (more of a tint!) - Tried Rom&nd JLT which is usually compared with RB but I find the latter more long lasting and just lightweight on the lips. Will repurchase when I can. (Already finished two this year!)


• KILL - Maybelline Skin Tint - Oxidizes shade darker, careful of picking your shade, better swatch it and wait for at least half an hour to see. Made me break out too.

1frwjxe,"Just learned the importance of HYDRATION 🧿 first of all i don’t want to jinx myself lmao

So I am a skincare newbie and I’ve been slowly understanding my skin type. I just learned the importance of hydration and realized that it was all I needed for my skin.

I started getting acne last year and I think it was this pink Ponds cream that triggered it. I also got some big cystic acne and upon research it seems they were hormonal. I’ve tried a bunch of different skincare products with different formulations both local and foreign, and they helped in some way but I think they also worsened my situation because I kept getting random bumps and acne even when my cystic acne went away. I’ve tried serums, masks, creams. I’ve experimented with Vitamin C, Aloe, Centella. I even tried using beauty bars as face cleansers which were so bad lol, caused some tiny CCs and itchiness on my face. 

And then recently I stumbled upon this thread on a skincare subreddit (can’t remember it anymore sadly). One person was asking how do you know if you have an oily skin or just a dehydrated normal skin. One person responded, if you wake up oily every morning then you have oily skin. But if you wake up with little to no oils and then progressively get oilier throughout the day, then you’re dehydrated. My dumbass thought all this time that I just have oily skin. It turns out, my skin probably is dehydrated and my skin barrier isn’t at its best state as well because of the different products I’ve used. I researched about the importance of hydration and apparently it’s a must to fight acne and other skin problems. 

I stopped using all of the skincare products I bought. Right now, I’m just doing a very simple skincare routine focused on hydration. 

AM:

Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser - very simple cleanser, my skin loves it, no itchiness after using it at all. I’ve heard it has some hydrating benefits too so I got it.

Hada Lado Shirojyun Lotion Light (Toner) (Applied on damp skin) - A lot of people are recommending Hada Labo so I bought it. I have some old PIH too so I chose the Shirojyun variant for lightening. It mainly has Hyaluronic Acid, some Vitamin C and Alpha Arbutin.

Aveeno sunscreen

PM:

Cetaphil Gentle Cleanser

Hada Labo Shirojyun Lotion Light (Toner) (on damp skin)

Hada Labo Shirojyun Milk Emulsion (on damp skin) - Using this as my moisturizer. Loved the Hada Labo Lotion so I thought of going all in with the brand. It has some Tranexamic Acid aside from Hyaluronic Acid for lightening. It’s a very, very light cream that transforms into water upon application. I always loved lightweight moisturizers since I’m from a very humid, tropical country.

It’s a very simple routine but the effects it gave me were amazing. My face got bouncy, PLUMP, more alive. Reduced the oils on my face throughout the day. PIH seems to be fading slowly. Face texture overall got smooth too. Got no acne flare ups too recently, made my face clear.

Overall I am very satisfied. Will prolly keep this simple routine since I am also a lazy ass and it takes less time to apply everything. Efficiency queen. 

So, yes, will prolly use skincare products focused on hydration and skin barrier from now on. Simple, not damaging on the skin, and gets the job done. 🥰

1epxgzk,"Products review Hey, so I got a few new products along with those that I am currently in love with. For context, my skin is combi-oily and with a medium-neutral undertone. 

* **Lancome teint Idole Ultra wear** (shade 345N) - I found myself reaching for this every time I go out. It keeps my oiliness at bay and while I can’t speak for its longevity when used in warm outdoor setting, coverage is still good even after 8 hours. Doesn't oxidize. I don't have any dark spots so can’t speak on how well it can cover it. 

* **Dior Forever Skin Correct concealer** (shade 2N) - it can be drying so I used it sparingly, and when I do it does not crease! 

* **Givenchy prism libre powder** (shade 3 Voile Rose and 4 Mousseline acidulee) - I used shade 3 to set my undereye and shade 4 to set my face. I find there’s shimmer in shade 3 but not too noticeable when set and it’s not drying. And speaking of shade 4, OMG *jaw drop* this powder set my face so beautifully. It’s mattifying but not too powdery if that makes sense. Hands down the best there is. The only con is *amoy Lola*  

* **Dior Forever Glow maximizer** (shade Gold) Set it with **Dior Backstage Glow Face Palette - the shimmer is subtle, but the glow looks natural. It looks barely there but I prefer it mesa magmukang oily, looks like a healthy sheen instead. 

* **Gucci bronzing powder (shade 2) - I swatch 2 and 3 at the store and while 2 is darker, 3 pulls orange on my skin tone so something to think about when deciding which shade to buy. Powder is easy to blend and the compact is so luxurious it feels like a treat when I use it. 

* **Dior lipstick (shade 623 mitzvah velvet) - hmm, it’s okay but since I have a two-toned lip It doesn't mask my lips completely. I think I have a few lippies with the same color as well. Bought it because it’s *Dior*.

1ic4jzq,"Makeup must-haves These are the items I find myself reaching for most often! I have combination-oily skin, light-medium, warm toned.

Base:
- NARS Pure Radiant Tinted Moisturizer in St. Moritz. My holy grail base makeup, since I don’t really use foundation and I work from home so I only use it during weekends and travels. It evens out my skin tone and texture so well! I find that it looks extra amazing in cooler weather, but it still works pretty well for me here in humid Manila.
- NARS Soft Matte Complete Concealer in Ginger. This is like live photoshop lol. Skin-like and covers up dark spots really well. I also don’t use concealer under my eyes so this is just for dark spots.
- Charlotte Tilbury Airbrush Flawless Finish pressed powder in Medium. Very natural finish, not cakey even when I use it to retouch and reduce oiliness throughout the day. Worth the hype! My dupe for this is the Canmake Marshmallow Powder.

Eyes:
- Rom&nd Han All Fix Mascara in Long Black. Lengthens my eyelashes without making them look too clumpy and thick. It looks very natural.
- K-Palette 1 Day Tattoo Eyeliner in black. The only liquid eyeliner that stays on my oily lids nearly all day.
- The Face Shop Designing Eyebrow Pencil in Gray Brown. I don’t use brow gel and I have naturally thick eyebrows so I just use this to emphasize the shape and make them stand out more on my face.
- Merzy The First Gel Eyeliner in Black Moon. This stays on much longer than liquid eyeliner. I like to use it on my waterline.

Cheeks:
- Rare Beauty liquid blush in Encourage. This shade almost perfectly matches the color of my cheeks when I blush lol.
- Clinique Cheek Pop in Black Honey Pop. This is my favorite blush formula! Buildable and watercolor-like. This shade looks so sophisticated yet natural on me.
- Clinique Cheek Pop in Peach Pop. I use this shade when I want to achieve a more youthful, playful vibe.

Lips:
- NARS Powermatte lipstick in Thunder Kiss. My perfect mauve and I love that I don’t have to retouch often when I use this. It’s pretty much transfer-proof.
- Dior Addict Hydrating Shine lipstick in 716 Dior Cannage. It’s not exactly hydrating for me but the shade is just gorgeous, it goes on so lush on my lips and the finish appears almost sparkly like a diamond.
- MAC Lustreglass lipstick in Posh Pit. I find satin, lustrous finishes more comfortable on my dry lips and MAC’s Lustreglass line is spot on. This shade is my MLBB and my default for errands, flights and quick days out.

Special mention lippies: 
- NARS Afterglow Sensual Shine Hydrating Lipstick in Turned On. This is a new one for me but I liked it because it’s actually hydrating! I was pleasantly surprised.
- MAC Macximal matte lipstick in Warm Teddy. Another MLBB that’s my go-to when I want to go matte.
- Dior Rouge Forever lipstick in 518 Forever Confident. I do feel more confident in this shade lol, it’s a lovely reddish brown that I’m not sure I can find elsewhere. The transfer-proof formula is a tad bit better than NARS Powermatte.

My makeup style is just natural — some might say it’s boring lol. So I don’t have a lot of eye makeup in my stash. I do feel like I’ve hit “makeup peace” now so I probably won’t be buying a lot anytime soon until I finish what I have! I’ve also found my staple brands now and I won’t be experimenting too much anymore. I want to use my hard-earned money on quality items that really work for me.

Here’s my experience on Belo’s Sunexpert Whitening Sunscreen:

* Fragrance: It has a light fragrance, it smells like makeup powder.

* Application: It’s spreadable but not lightweight. There’s a slight tingling sensation in the first 10 minutes or so of applying it. My face feels hot after using it kahit nakabukas ang AC. *It just feels unpleasant.*

* Finish: It doesn’t leave a whitecast but it feels greasy. It leaves a lasting feeling/weight.

● Stila Boss Beauty Gloss - Winwin

● Issy Hydragloss - Off Duty

● Romand Glasting Color Gloss - Dim Mauve

● Romand Glasting Melting Balm - Kaya Fig

● Nature Republic Honey Melting Lip - Plum

● Peripera Ink Lasting Lip Gloss - Made It

Preference: Glossy, heavy, thick, good grip, good color. 

☆STILA☆
Thick, heavy, smells nice, really good grip. If you're looking for a gloss GLOSS, this is it. Not budget friendly though


☆ISSY☆
Really thin, and no stickiness! ""watery gloss"" than a ""lava gloss"" ifykwim (shade off duty has glitters). Super runny though, no grip (check pics). Moisturizing on me naman.


☆GLASTING COLOR GLOSS☆
Had to use one dip on each lip. Idk if it's this color pero I have to put a color underneath it or else i'll look like a corpse 😭. Formula is comparable to stila, but more budget friendly!


☆GLASTING MELTING BALM☆
Packaging gets messy easily, but is retractable. Thick, and sticky. Love the shade range + gives color and leaves my lips moisturized .


☆NATURE REPUBLIC☆
Thin, sticky, love the feel, but I have to smack my lips for even application. Color disappears quickly though, but moisture is still there. Glossier than romand balm.


☆PERIPERA☆
The formula of this surprised me because I was expecting it to be thick? but it's lightweight and thin. Like Issy, but better grip. Watery gloss than lava gloss.


If I had to pick a favorite it would be the stila one! this is just based on preference but you do you. Make up should be based on what makes you feel and look your best. Have a good day ♡

1mko3sd,"All you really need is a good skin (type). I have (had) severe oily skin. I used to think hyped makeup does not work for me. 

I have tried Estee Lauder DW foundation, Charlotte Tilbury setting spray, MAC studio fix powder and spray, but none of them worked for me like they worked for other people. Don’t get me wrong, I liked how it applies and looks on my face; but it doesn’t stay as long as I would like. I still would get oily in just a few hours. 

I decided to consult a dermatologist to address my skin concern. I have mild acne, focusing on my chin and jaw area. She gave me an option either to try oral antibiotics or to go straight to Isotretinoin. I chose the latter as I have previously tried oral antibiotics. 

After having my lab tests done, I was cleared to take Isotretinoin. She prescribed a low-dose Isotretinoin (10mg) to be taken once a day. I did not “purge.” I am in my second month, and so far so good. 

My makeup wears wonderfully throughout the day. Not once do I feel the need to retouch. The sunnies infamous blush? The one that is gone in a minute? Yeah it stayed the whole day on my face. I never even had to use my CT setting spray! Unbelievable!

I did not change anything in my makeup routine. All that was changed was Isotretinoin.

1h79yb0,"GRWM Cosmetics Face Card I've been using their Quad Goals ever since they released it and it's one of my go-to palette. Con lang for me is yung case cos it tends to pop-out. 

That's why I was so happy when they released this new Face Card Collection with the new magnetics case + new other products. It's overwhelming but at least they gave us so much options to choose from and you can curate talaga pang whole face. 

The products that I immediately bought are the products that I'm most interested. 

✨️ Mochi blush ( Muse and Breakfast in Bed)- I love any cream to powder blushes as an oily girl since lasts on me whole day. Eto agad target kong bilhin compared sa other blushes nila. I used the two shades on my face (see photos) and they look similar compared when I swatched it on my hands. Muse is neutral nude coral, Breakfast in Bed is neutral medium pink, as what they described it.

I expected it to be overly pigmented, especially Breakfast in Bed, but it's not. Compared Colourette Colourbounce na sobrang pigmented, eto enough lang yung pigment and needs to build up. Blendable but I prefer to blend it with fingers. Idk if it's my brush or what, but whenever I apply it with brush, konti lang nalalagay. Parang mas maraming kumakapit sa brush compared sa skin 🫠 Still 50/50 with this blush. And so far, colourbounce is more long-lasting on me.

✨️ Soft Veil Finishing Powder (Juno) - creators are at it again with ""dupes"" and parang hourglass daw 'to. Can't confirm kasi wala ako nun.  But I actually like the glow it gives. I expected it to have shimmers na mala-highlighter but there's none. 

Also, I noticed that it has a ""silvery/whitish 
"" shade on it when applied, which I think that gives that lumonisity, pero it looks natural naman after a while. Maybe the shade is  not compatible with my skintone, since this is their lightest shade.

✨️ Brontour Powder (Moccachino) - I was expecting this to be pigmented as well, but it's not for me. I had to build it up for it to show up, similar to their previous contour/bronzer powders from Quad Goals. Maybe got the wrong shade as well :( Probs too light on me. 


Anyway, that's my first impression so far with these new products from GRWM. Medyo underwhelming for me (except the finishing powder). 

Am I still going to buy from this collection? Yes pa rin 😂 

Hope this helps kahit medyo di ako ganun kagaling mag describe and explain hehe 🫠

1f5nqij,"August empties (+ reviews)! - Tsubaki hair mask - love it and already repurchased, trying out the Sakura version. For me, mas okay tong gold. Mas moisturizing. I don’t care much for the smell since I use Lush Super Milk as well.

- Rare Beauty Lip Oil in Wonder - it was meh and will not repurchase. May minty feel when you apply it and feels more like a tint than lip oil. It’s too pricey for what it offers, mas gusto ko pa ung Strokes lip oil kesa dito. Tint also does not last, mag-Romand ka na lang. It also oxidizes to a darker shade, which I do not appreciate. 

- Clinique Moisture Surge 100 - I used up my last travel size, a freebie, from my regular-sized one. Already made a dent on my 30ml. Love this so much! A little on the expensive side, so make sure to buy during sale since grabe mag-drop ng prices/BOGO ang Laz account nila ng double digit sales. So I usually buy during those times.

- The Elf serum - Already on my second bottle! This lightened the lines on my UA and that pesky dark spot on my underbutt. I put it directly on those areas and then put some on my lotion/body oil for other parts of my body. Sinks into your akin right away. Product’s color red but does not stain my clothes.

- Anessa sunscreen - one of my favorite sunscreens! Finally used up the 60ml which I bought in May 2023 and only fully finished it this month. I exclusively use it everyday so ang tagal maubos mga sis, well worth your money lalo if you buy it in Japan because it also comes with that mini one na I also recently finish and at cheaper price. As in sobrang mura, shooketh ako na nasa 2k dito sa Pinas so I bought another one when we came back this Feb sa Japan. I bring that mini one on my travels naman. Currently using Canmake, another one of my favorite sunscreens just to ✨spice ✨ things up. Chariz. I love both since they work so well under makeup and hindi talaga ko nasusunog kahit pag nasa beach trip. 

- Laneige Water Bank eye cream - got this as a freebie when I got the Laneige cushion and wow, super moisturizing! Whenever I use this, hindi talaga nag-cling ang concealer or color corrector sa undereye ko. Love it! I’m not buying it soon since I still have six, yes di ko rin alam bakit anim, more eye creams on my rotation. 🙃 I used to hate eye creams lol.

- Dior Forever mini in 2N - ganda nito for oily ghorls. It sets so beautifully and pag nag-mix na sa natural oils mo, chef’s kiss talaga. Anti-hulas. Con: bilis niya mag-set so you have to work faster when using it. Personally, would not repurchase since I have another mini like this sa office and I have 7 more base makeup that are not running out soon that I love more than this. And if ever I bit the bullet on a Dior foundation, I’ll probably opt for the skin glow since this one performs like my MUFE HD and that one is much, much easier to blend than this.

Ayun lang! Exciting din pala mag-ubos ng binili kesa bumili nang bumili ng bagong product! Mas exciting pa nga at times hehe. I’m not sure if I’ll have this much pans/empties on September, but I’m working on finally finishing my first lip bullet, so exciting times ahead pa rin naman hehe.",https://i.redd.it/x4wyrewb80md1.jpeg,270,60,Empties,"clinique, canmake, romand, laneige, into you","international, international, international, international, international","foundation, concealer, makeup, color corrector",,2024-08-31,Neutral

products:
• romand juicy lasting tint in peach honey b, mellow pear, and odd grape: 9.5/10 - super love this especially the new shade mellow pear. my first ever shade from this line was bare grape and that’s still my top 1 shade up to this day. -0.5 though because it oxidizes and becomes dark throughout the day, but i’ll say na it’s still the same color naman and hindi nag tturn into reddish tints. i really recommend mellow pear for neutral tones it’s such a pretty nude.

• absidy soft cheeks whipped serum blush in poppy and peach blossoms: 8/10 - i absolutely love the formula of this but idk if it’s only me, pero nahihirapan akong kumuha ng product because of the applicator. but overall, it’s perfect for girlies with oily skin and gives the soft matte diffused look. 

• chu chu beauty matte bomb in 90’s brown: 5/10 - really meh for me. nothing special.

• issy mousse lip tint in bitten: 7/10 - it’s like a thinner version of the sunnies’ lip dip. i’m not a fan of the scent, it smells super synthetic and chemically for some reason. the longevity is not that great, as in kahit nagsasalita ka lang, mabilis syang matanggal. but if u like the look of soft matte lips that’s barely there, u’ll definitely love this.

• issy lip bullet in decollete: 10/10 - this on the pther hand quickly became my holy grail lippie. this is so suitable for neutral tones. i’ve been trying to find a pinkish nude lippie that’s light enough and i’m glad i found it na. also love the formula of this, not drying at all but still looks matte.

• issy powder blush insert in intimate and aroused: 9/10 - super love the shades of this. aroused for cool tones and intimate for neutral tones. medyo na-off lang ako sa sinabi ng iba na it’s super long lasting when it’s not (if u have oily skin). but i honestly don’t mind it because the shades are so freaking gorj.

• etude house lovely cookie blusher in peach choux: 8/10 - this shade is also suitable for neutral tones and warm tones. i do find that i have to build it up pa but i think that’s because i’m morena. longevity is slightly better than issy’s. i wanna try other shades pa.

• chu chu beauty heart blush duo in love candy: 2/10 - i really had high hopes for this. i thought i’ll love it but it’s just too pigmented to the point na it’s very hard to make it work. or idk maybe i just chose the wrong shade. i really don’t know someone who’ll use the candy shade alone.

Maybelline Color Sensational Ultimatte - it was gifted to me after I told my friend I love the shade on her (she’s too sweet!), so I don’t know the exact color. I love the mattifying effect and neutral mauve shade

Sunnies Lip Tracer in nudie - this was my first lip liner and loved the shade (can be paired with all my lippies) and its blendable texture; however it isn’t long lasting. The lip liner and brush duo is very convenient and handy too

Kiko Milano Unlimited Double Touch Liquid Lipstick - also gifted by same friend so I’m not sure about the exact shade. It is transfer proof and long lasting but it dries my lips. Still my go-to lippie right now

Rare Beauty Stay Vulnerable Glossy Lip Balm in neutral - pasabuy from Sephora US, it leaves a bit sticky feels after application but it is quite long lasting and serves its purpose

For now I’m satisfied with my staples but I’m thinking of trying a new lip liner. Please do recommend your faves, hopefully with neutral-pink-mauve shades and transfer proof!

1dq995s,"Sunnies Blush On I have been a fan of Sunnies since their Fluffmatte era, but lately I felt like their products are not it.

Before you come for me, I find ALL their products very aesthetically pleasing but lately their releases seem to aim to marketed as dupes of other international products. While it is good for us who cannot afford higher end products all the time, I just hope local brands release products and appreciate it as it is—not a dupe of another product.

For Sunnies Blush On, I was planning to purchase this the moment they launched it and was waiting for it to be released online. But thankfully, I was able to drop by their physical store.

No doubt, their packaging is very cute! But I was surprised how messy it becomes and looks considering it’s placed upright. Formula-wise, it’s dewy (great for no makeup makeup), it is long lasting on my hand but I cannot speak about its longevity once on the cheeks especially for those with oily skin types.

The shade range is gorgeous but honestly, it’s the same as all the other shades other local brands have. It’s a GOOD buy IF you either: (1) don’t have a cream blush of that shade, (2) you don’t have a dewy blush. Otherwise, it’s a pass (for me).

Other Sunnies products I liked recently:
- Skin So Good Setting Spray
- Dream Cream
- Lip Tracer
- Lash Seeker + Lash Curler

1cu2wf6,"DIY Brazilian Wax Just wanting to share this here. I stopped shaving for almost 5 years or more na ata and this is is my routine

I wax kapag more than 1in yung length of hair. I do it every 2 months pero YMMV kasi slow talaga hair growth ko down there kahit shaving pa ako

Reason I switched to waxing was grabe yung ingrown hair and yung kati kapag yung cut hair eh nagpepenetrate na ulit sa skin

A day before the wax: I gentle exfoliate down there, up and down lang mga mi, wag circular and key word here is gently. I use plain sugar or sugar + carrier oil. I don’t use any whitening or what down there kasi sensitive ako

The day of the wax, I do it at the end of the day after I shower. Syempre prep mo na yung waxing machine mo, imelt mo na yung wax beads and your powder (I use the johnsons baby powder cornstarch).

I do this on the floor and naglalatag ako ng any type of newpaper na uupuan ko. Tapos apply your powder para dry talaga yung skin

Check the temp of your wax on the inner side of your wrist, dapat hindi masyadong mainit. Then iapply mo na yung wax, for applicator bumibili lang ako ng tongue depressor sa pharmacy (mga 5pesos lang)

Direction of wax application is against the hair growth direction. So for me, from bottom going up pagapply ko

Generally, dapat ganun din magpull, pero never ko ginawa yun kasi takot ako na masyadong masakit so pagpull ko is from top to bottom

Wala namang side effects

Tapos do small areas, wag kayo magapply ng big areas or iiyak talaga kayo

Yung small areas ko is like 1 - 1.5inch in length tapos di ko na nilalapadan

Based on my experience, okay lang umulit ulit sa isang area kapag may naiiwan pero huwag gawin if super sensitive talaga skin nyo

Makukuha nyo din

Pain during the first few times is 10/10 haha, no bleeding naman. Now mga 4.5/10 nalang tapos dati mga 50mins to an hour ako magwawax kasi syempre kailangan ko icheer sarili ko, now mga 20-30mins nalang

Lifechanging for me. Di ko na need pumunta sa iba para ipawax haha pero maybe in the future magpapaIPL ako. For now, eto ang pasok sa budget",https://www.reddit.com/r/beautytalkph/comments/1cu2wf6/diy_brazilian_wax/,259,50,Review,mac,international,powder,,2024-05-17,Neutral

1ce599i,"Issy's metallic coating on their component is such a hard pass To be fair, this is from their release formerly under Issy and Co. branding and I bought this on sale for under PHP 100 from a Shopee live selling last 12.12 sale, hence the discounted price (I couldn't remember the original price). 

This is my second purchase of their Micro Detailing Pen and I've had the same exact experience before with the silver flaking & scraping off of the component. It's truly frustrating that I can't put it in my kit together with other makeup otherwise it will scrape further and the silver flakes will get anywhere, making it really inconvenient for me. It even gets on to my face which is sooooo annoying because it's like craft glitter that's so difficult to remove. Instead of finishing my makeup in 10-12 minutes, removing the flecks even adds so much more time to my routine. 

As someone whose ick is dirty makeup packaging, this is a pass for me, despite liking the overall performance of the brow pen on me. Ang dugyot tignan talaga. Before, I would wrap it in tissue pa to protect it from scraping but that has become inconvenient for me now that I have a small makeup/grooming pouch containing several other items. I plan to switch to blk's microblading mascara once I finish this.  

Kayo ba? Have you had the same experiences with this type of packaging from Issy / Issy & Co.? Did they improve the packaging already together with their rebranding? 

Any thoughts, comments, and maybe suggestions would be appreciated! 🫶🏻

1f2cxaw,"The lip peptide battle by Hi everyone. I bought these three lip peptide balm treatments to compare which one is actually better than the rest! Side note: I have two toned lips, I wont be using a lip liner so we can see how it looks as is.


🩷 Sunnies Coquette - 7/10 actually its nice, slightly heavy on the lips but it does moisturize it well. I think its because it is almost the same ingredients as in rhode. Its applicator is similar to that of summer fridays. Pigment-wise not the best. As you can see on my arm, konti lang ung pigment niya and on the lips hindi siya halata. You have to apply more of the pigment if you want it to pop and as a “tint” it fails to be one. The only thing that gives it a higher score is its price. It’s the most inexpensive of all three. Is it worth it? I honestly think it is for you to decide. Less pigment but moisturizing.

🤎 Rhode Expresso - 10/10 I love it! I like how it glides smoothly sa lips. A little goes a long way because it is pigmented. It makes me look like a baddie while moisturizing my lips to perfection. I only needed to reapply twice the entire day too. This is also my first time buying rhode and I am impressed. It is very slightly heavy on the lips but not as bad as I thought. It is a little expensive but I think the quality speaks for itself.

❤️ Summer fridays Cherry - 9/10 This is the most pigmented of the two (look at arm photo) it also looks really nice on the lips. It is also the most lightweight of the three which I really like. I feel like I have nothing on my lips. However after 3-4 hours i need to reapply to keep the moisture locked on my lips. I also have a difficulty applying it, theres a lot of air inside the tube and you need to squeeze a bit more to get product out. This is also the most expensive among the three.

PS if you see fiber on the applicator of Summer fridays, it is only there because i tried cleaning it with a cotton ball so thats where that fiber came from 😅

Final thoughts: Honestly if it were me, I would just stick with laneige sleeping lip mask. It basically has the same main ingredients and moisturizes your lips and will last you a looooong time. You can use it as a balm in the morning too! However, don’t get this if you don’t like the heaviness on your lips because it is a little heavy.

I am happy to try the three products but I am still eyeing to try the Laneige and Ole Henriksen lip balms!",https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1f2cxaw,257,40,Review,"sunnies, rhode, laneige","local, local, international","lip liner, lip balm, lip balms",,2024-08-27,Neutral
1iumnvi,"Short unhinged perfume reviews I wasn't really into perfumes growing up (as a sheltered kid with a traumatic past chariz). Siguro I started with Elizabeth Arden Green Tea kasi bigay ng pinsan ko until mabasag yun ng nanay ko at hindi na napalitan. Oh well. The first bottle I blind bought was a dupe of V&R Flowerbomb. From then, I knew biased ako sa powdery scents. Naubos ko ba? Hindi. I used it too much when I was still with my ex kaya when we broke up, I associated the scent with her kaya ang ending binigay ko din sa nanay ko. At diyan nagsimula ang frag journey ko. Here are my short unhinged perfume reviews of the scents I've smelled and owned since then:

# Al Rehab

1. Choco Musk - At first, amoy bagong hinipan na kandila. Mumurahin na chocolate kalaunan.

# Creation Lamis

1. Dark Fever - Perfume ng yumao kong uncle, binigay sa kapatid ko pero di niya ginagamit. Ito ginagamit ko kapag may major life event ako. Conflicting sa internet kung ano ba talaga dupe nito. Bagong lutong apple pie (hindi McDo, made to order na apple pie). Pang gabi lang kasi cloying kapag mainit.

# Le Labo

1. The Noir 29 Le Labo (fake) - Oo, alam ko, dapat di bumibili ng fake kasi malayo talaga (minsan) yung amoy sa legit. Amoy ng gabi pagkatapos bumagyo. Pantulog scent ko kapag di ko malimutan mag spray.
2. Santal 33 (Eternal Scents) - Wanted to find out why everyone smelled like this. Amoy lumber yard.
3. Gaiac 10 (Eternal Scents) - Bunsong kapatid ni Santal 33. Amoy bagong tasang lapis, settles down into a VERY excellent powderiness. Naubos ko pero di pa ako bumibili ulit.

# YSL

1. Libre (totoong decant) - Amoy sampaguita all throughout dios kong mahabagin
2. Y (totoong decant) - Pinaamoy sakin ng pinsan ko para daw sana as wedding scent niya kasi sobrang meta sa Fraghead PH (rip). Amoy safeguard na puti.

# Prada

1. L'Homme (totoong decant tsaka Cotidiano) - Same story with the YSL Y above. Amoy mabait, very powdery but still masculine. There's a depth dito na di masyado kuha ng Cotidiano pero gamit ko pa din as a daily scent.

# Dior

1. Fahrenheit (totoong bottle) - Perfume ng tatay ko since magjowa sila ng nanay ko. Amoy gasolina.
2. Dior Homme Intense (totoong decant) - Amoy aunty ko na mayaman. Siguro kasi very iris forward. I prefer L'Homme over this.

# Maison Martin Margiela

1. Lazy Sunday Morning (totoong decant) - Pinaamoy lang sakin ng friend ko na may jowa na nasa Canada na di niya alam naghahanap na pala ng kalaguyo. Amoy good girl, typical freshie white floral. Very kaiba sa ugali ng friend ko na yun kaya pangit na din association ko sa scent na to.
2. Jazz Club (totoong decant) - Amoy alak. Ayoko at first spray kasi may lemon, masakit sa ulo.
3. Coffee Break (Eternal Scents) - Decant lang at nawala kaagad kaya di ko naappreciate masyado. Amoy kape na mamahalin, hindi Nescafe.

# MFK

1. Baccarat Rouge (Eternal Scents) - Nagpadala lang sa hype. Sakit sa ulo. Amoy dentista na may pagka cotton candy.
2. Gentle Fluidity Silver (Elnaris) - Not your average clean scent. Very sharp and metallic.
3. Gentle Fluidity Gold (Eternal Scents tsaka Fragrance World) - The first time my sister sprayed this on her wrist, gusto ko siyang kagatin. First perfume that made me have such a visceral reaction. Parang violet na sugus. Di ganun ka smoky yung gawa ni Fragrance World pero ok na din.
4. 724 (Cotidiano) - Amoy sampaguita ulit at first spray jusko po. Pink na safeguard kalaunan.  



# Louis Vuitton

As a preface, I hate hate hate citrus heavy scents kasi amoy air freshener ng mga Grab, masakit sa ulo. Everything changed with this lineup ng LV.

1. Imagination (Cotidiano) - Di ko gets yung hype at first, pero after a few days grabe. Amoy mamahaling iced tea. Hindi Nestea. Yung mabibili mo sa Let's Eat Pare.
2. Afternoon Swim (Volare Above the Clouds) - Amoy Royal Tru Orange.

ooihqx,"List of SPF30 and SPF50 Sunscreens available at Watson's that are priced below P400 but above 50mL in amount + reviews Hello po :) While looking for a sunscreen, I saw that a lot of the recommendations are above P500 and have dangerous inauthentic copies sold for very cheap prices online. There are authentic sunscreens that sell for cheap but I don't want to take the risk with the many fakes around, and I don't want to rely on sales to afford the authentic ones. 

I want a sunscreen that is

☑️ Below P400

☑️ 50mL or more for that price

☑️ Accessible

☑️ Guaranteed authenticity

So I checked the official Watson's Shopee page and listed all the sunscreen that fits that criteria and compiled product reviews. 

DISCLAIMERS: 

⛔ **Reviews are not mine**. They come from many different buyers so there may be conflicting reviews. I mostly included repeating reviews in the compilation (such as many buyers saying there's a whitecast, or light consistency, etc.) but I included breakouts even if only 1 review mentioned it. Reviews are mostly unedited except for English translations. 

⛔ **All data is taken from Shopee**. If the product sold on Watson's does not have enough reviews, I take reviews from other shops. 

⛔ **These are not the cheapest prices available for these products**. While researching I found authentic resellers at much lower prices, but I only include Watson's as a reference for the *ceiling price* of these products so we do not go above the budget. 

Arranged from cheapest to most expensive:

*Fresh Milk White Tone Up Sun Cream SPF30*

  - P199 for 50mL

  - Positive Reviews: good for sensitive skin, non sticky, lightweight, somehow waterproof according to a test by a buyer*, didn't cause breakout, good coverage, brightens up face

  - Negative Reviews: caused a breakout, very small amount, has whitecast, peels off when scratched, makes skin oilier after a while

  - Neutral Reviews: mild milk smell, runny and creamy texture

*the waterproof test was conducted by rinsing the face slightly and the buyer claimed the glow from the sunscreen was still intact


*Luxe Organix Ultimate Defense Tinted Sunscreen UVA/UVB Protection Warm*

  - P279 (discounted) for 50g
  - original price: P349

  - Positive Reviews: doesn't break out skin after one week of usage, good smell, not sticky on the face, easy to spread, no adverse reaction on skin, works for oily skin, lightweight

  - Negative Reviews: no matte finish, warm on the face, not reef friendly

  - Neutral Reviews: shade looks good on morena skin, kind of runny but dries quickly, medium coverage, dewy finish, recommended by John Rey (YouTube)

*Cathy Doll L Glutathione Magic Cream SPF50*

  - P279 for 60mL

  - Positive Reviews: smells good, cooling effect, lightweight, not sticky, safe for face, matte finish, HG for several customers

  - Negative Reviews: slight white cast but quick to blend into face

  - Neutral Reviews: effectively whitens skin


*HYALOO Aqua Plus Water Cream SPF50 PA+++*

  - P345 for 50mL

  - Glow Boost version: same price

  - Positive Reviews: no whitecast, moisturizes skin, makes skin glow, super mild, no stinging, has ceramides for skin barrier repairing, not sticky, good for oily skin, no negative reaction on skin

  - Negative Reviews: feels like the product is not that full in the package, makes face look oily, strong smell

  - Neutral Reviews: slightly watery and runny, recommended by John Rey (YouTube), hyped by Filipino content creators


*Luxe Organix Aqua Daily Sunscreen with SPF50 plus UVA/UVB Protection*
  - P349 for 50mL

  - Positive Reviews: scent not as strong as Neutrogena, scent disappears after applying on face, fresh smell, lightweight, not sticky at all, no whitecast, no adverse reaction on skin, easily absorbs, soft on the skin, no breakouts

  - Negative Reviews: pump doesn't work consistently

  - Neutral Reviews: gel type instead of lotion type


*Belo SunExpert Whitening Sunscreen SPF50*

  - P375 for 50mLs

  - Face Cream version: P350

  - Positive Reviews: moisturizing, did not cause breakout, unscented, lightweight, safe sunscreen, apparently brightens and smoothens skin, HG of several customers

  - Negative Reviews: small amount inside tube (appears to be less than 50mL), sticky on sweaty face, apparently caused pimples on chin

  - Neutral Reviews: dewy finish, recommended for oily skin by Jan Angelo (skincare Youtuber)


*Nivea Sun Protect and Moisture Facial Cream SPF50*

  - P395 for 50mL

  - Positive Reviews: good smell

  - not much available reviews


**Bonus:**

*Human Nature SafeProtect SPF 30 PA++++ Mineral Sunscreen*

  - P300 for 50g (Human Nature Manila Branch shop)
  - P251 for 50g (Nature of Beauty shop)

  - P398 for 100g (Nature of Beauty shop)

  - Positive Reviews: coral reef friendly, good smell / no harsh smell, easy to blend into skin, doesn't cause breakouts, safe for pregnant people, keeps skin smooth and hydrated, safe for people with sensitive skin and allergies to certain chemicals

  - Negative Reviews: incredibly sticky, severe white cast, not scent-free, thick consistency that is difficult to use with makeup, high concentration of coconut oil, no silicones

  - Neutral Reviews: must be shaken well before applying, claimed to be for face and body by Human Nature


I haven't tried any of these yet so I can't vouch for them but I will share when I do!

What are your thoughts on this list and the reviews? If you've tried them, did the reviews conflict or agree with your experience? Am I the only one here who refuses to buy SPF above P500? ^_^

I saw an advice from a derma to those on a budget: buy the basics (Moisturizer, cleanser, sunscreen) for cheap and go crazy for the more targeted products!

**EDIT TO ADD 1**: This post is intended as a starting point for research and not a guaranteed recommendation. Please be wise and do your own research before buying!

**ETA 2:** I am also planning to measure how many days 50mL, 60mL, 80mL etc amount of sunscreen lasts to find out if the price difference between the sizes are worth it. For ex. if 50mL lasts 60 days with daily 2 finger application, and 60mL lasts 70 days, and the price difference between the two is P100, then basically we are paying P100 for 10 days. Just an example, likely incorrect. I have not begun but I am sharing it for those who might want to do this too or to those who have already done it, please share results!

**ETA 3**: I might make a post similar to this one but not limited to official Watson's shopee store. I learned from the discussion that there are a lot of sunscreens that fit my criteria on official sites, Lazada, etc. Plus I want to add ingredients list, SPF tests and controversies aside from just reviews. If someone else wants to do it too then I support :)

back in december i wore issy's lip bullet satin in shade seraph to a pool outing. i took a shower and dipped in the water and after some time in the water my friends asked what lipstick i wore. thinking that they just liked the shade, i told them. they told me that my lips still had the lipstick stain on them after dunking my head in the water so many times.

i had to see it for myself! so i wore the lippie again (note, i always do a full lip when i wear these) while eating samgyup. after the meal, i went to check on my lips and sure enough , a faint stain was still there. 

i also tested out the velvet formula and found that it stained and stayed on my lips much longer even after eating through an entire large milktea size cup of halo halo.

1hhykgw,"PRODUCTS THAT ARE ACTUALLY WORTH IT FOR ME THIS 2024 Hi -

I love reading through this sub and learning about other people's reviews on certain products i may or may not be eyeing to try. I know the struggle of filtering out which products are actually worth buying due to the overwhelming products being released on the market these days and I hope this post helps whoever may find this.

I wanted to share products that i have incorporated in my routine that have actually made a difference and will be repurchasing all the time.

**HAIR CARE-**

**Shiseido Tsubaki Premium Hair Mask** \- as someone who spent years bleaching and dyeing her hair every month since high school, it took a while for my hair to regrow and heal. I finally decided to invest money on products that would help heal my damaged hair. Being a frugal person, going to the salon was out of the question. I simply do not have the time nor energy to go to a salon every month or few months. I decided to buy the fino and tsubaki hair mask since as per my research, japanese hair care products are top tier and they are IN FACT TOP TIER. I use this once every 4 days and you can immediately see the difference after use. Hair has never felt so soft and smooth. 10000000/10

I don't use conditioner anymore. I feel like hair masks works better and stronger than a regular conditioner. I also feel like it helps me save money since one tub of this hair masks lasts me 4-5 months vs buying a conditioner every month. One scoop is more than enough tbh.

*tsubaki vs fino -* I prefer tsubaki more as it works better for my hair type. Last year, i cut my hair to a bob to get rid of all the damaged/fried ends of my hair. My hair is now around 18-20 inches longer and I think that plays a factor on why the fino hair mask did not work for me. Fino is more suited for people who have bleached and thickened hair.

Also --- a runner up for those in a budget, i bought the VitaKeratin Salon Daily Treatment Deep Repair (Black variant) for more or less 200 pesos. this one also works well but you have to apply a generous amount to achieve the effect that tsubaki offers.

**&Honey Melty Moist Repair Oil** \- I wasn't too sure about this product at first because my hair does tend to oil up quickly (but then realized i just wasn't taking good care of it back then). I use this regularly and trust me when I say, this gives such a glossy shine and makes my hair look 1000x healthier. On days that I don't use the hair mask, i rely on this one to make it smooth and shiny. A bit expensive as it retails for about 700-900 pesos on the orange app but will last you up to a year. One pump is all you need, trust me. Putting too much will end up looking greasy.

**MAKEUP -**

Foundation/Base- I have oily skin and sometimes it does get dry since i use tretinoin at night. I also have a lot of texture/acne scars on my skin as someone who previously suffered from acne for most of my life so I am very particular with makeup. These are the ones that I have impressed me and have made my makeup game so much better and I only use cushion foundations nowadays.

**Happy Skin Second Skin Dewy Serum Cushion**\- I previously made a review on the matte variant. I liked that one but I LOVE THE DEWY ONE MORE. One of the things I realized this year is that matte products do not work on me despite being an oily girlie. Whenever i use matte foundations, it looks cakey AF at the end of the day. When i finally caved and tried the dewy variant, i knew i have found my daily make up base. It has a light dewy finish. Makeup blends in my skin seamlessly even when i oil up it just looks like a better version of my skin.

**Jung Saem Mool Essential Skin Nuder Cushion** \- GRABE  LAKAS MAKA GLASS SKIN!!!!!  I use this when i have to go to an event or a night out. It does not break me out. It lasts a long time before my oily skin separates it lol. This has medium coverage with a glowy finish. Only con is that they have a very limited shade range. ( as most korean brands)

**BLUSH** \- i have two blushes that have impressed me this year -

**Lilybyred Luv Beam Cheek Balm in the shade: Innocent Pink** \- FOR THE IDOL LOOK. I have been on the hunt for a white-ish pink blush and i have finally found it. This lasts me the whole day and very subtle siya but you can build it up. 100000/10

**Chu Chu Beauty Multiuse Heart Paint in Pink Bunny -** FOR THE GIRLIES WHO NEED PIGMENT. Grabe pigment. Will last you the whole day. One dot is enough. I had very low expectations with this brand but i am impressed with this one. I might buy their powder blush in Miss Dolly.

\-----a runner up, Absidy's soft cheeks whipped serum blush in Lover. I like this one as well but you to apply multiple layers  to see the pigment.

**POWDER**  \-

Absidy's complexion blur translucent perfecting powder in Oat and Petal - very blurring. tbh i've only ever tried a few powders so i wouldn't say this is the best on the market but it doest the job. I use oat for everyday use and petal for when i want to look extra pretty.

**LIPSTICK -**

sad to say that i have not found a lippie that i liked. have only been using issy's satin bullet for the whole year and i'm not too sure i'd repurchase.

**SETTING SPRAY -** I have only ever used Charlotte Tilburry and Elf's setting spray and although CT is top-tier. It's just too expensive.

**ISSY TRUE FLEX ALL DAY SETTING SPRAY** \- Super happy with this purchase and it's affordable so major plus!!

**SKINCARE -** go to a trusted and certified dermatologist to help you build a regime that will work best for your skin and once you have a solid regime, you can ask for their advice if you want to try out other products to make sure that they won't cancel each other out and won't react badly to other skin care products you are already using. TRUST ME ON THIS!!! It will help save you time, money, energy and will help you build your confidence!!!

\*\*I don't use eyeliners, eyeshadows nor mascaras.

WELP that's it for me. This is such a long post and if you made it til the end, i greatly appreciate it. Also, please take everything you see on the internet with a grain of salt. These products may have worked and performed well on me but that does not guarantee it will work for you.

10nwsqy,"I just found out that buy nothing/pamigay fb groups are a thing, and now my beauty stash has so much less clutter I spent the whole of January deep cleaning and reorganizing our house. It's been really satisfying, and it encouraged me to finally confront the basket of clothes I've outgrown that's been living in the corner of my room. These were clothes that I used in my teens that became too tight or too childish, as well as clothes gifted from relatives that weren't my taste or my size. I don't have any younger cousins to give them to, and I didn't want to dump them on NGOs or recycling programs since I've heard a lot of them are at full warehouse capacity. I've also tried selling clothes on carousell in the past, and it took MONTHS for them to sell out. There are just too many clothes in circulation😢 

So anyway, I decided to start on the ""desirable"" pieces that were fashionable and in good condition. The bulk of these were office clothes from my mom. I posted on a fashion swap fb group and offered them up for free, and within 30mins almost everything was taken 🥰 It's such a great feeling, regaining storage space while knowing that the items won't go to waste. I'm honestly hooked, and I've asked my mom for other clothes she'd be interested in decluttering. On another group, I met an incoming college freshman who was looking for skincare and makeup. She accepted some face products and frags that I was planning to pan, and we encouraged each other with life while she picked out the items she wanted. (she still needs a brow pencil/brow product and concealer btw if anyone is interested in offloading some) 

I know not all interactions in these groups will be this smooth or pleasant, and it is a bit time consuming to pack everything and organize deliveries, but I've had some really good experiences so far and I'm excited to tackle the rest of my excess clothes (and maybe shoes and books too).

Have you had any good/bad experiences with pamigay groups? Or do you have other ways of reducing/repurposing your unused beauty products? I'd love to know!

1f9hrql,"This week’s makeup rotation for work 🥼 • First Base — dethroned ang favorite kong Issy Skin Tint with this. It works better on my oily skin and may light coverage as it covers some of my redness. I’m Sienna sa Issy and based sa swatch guide ng colourette, I’m Anilao but that’s out of stock so I got Laiya instead. Okay naman but if maubos ko ‘to I’d definitely repurchase Anilao since feel ko nga as in perfect shade match ko siya. 

• Nars pot concealer — no explanation needed! I use this on top of grwm’s green color corrector for my acne marks. 

• Rare Beauty blush in Love — this shade is best for morenas! Lakas maka-glow and very kinilig lang yung effect. Careful lang not to apply too much kasi pag nasobrahan mukhang sinampal ng hotdog sa mukha. 

• Maybelline Fit Me blush in Hopeful — binili ko dahil same vibe daw ng Nars O blush pero di ko siya bet. Oily ako so ayoko ng shimmer shimmer sa blush. Ginagamit ko lang siya for the sake of it. Sayang eh.

• Colourette Brow Bestie — di ko talaga gets yung mga mahal na pangkilay kasi feel ko pare-pareho lang sila? Yung gets ko lang ay ABH na pomade dahil yun talaga ang HG ko noon. This one is no different from my Benefit Precisely My Brow? I bought this kasi ito una kong nakita sa mall tapos nagmamadali ako haha. 

• Vice Lip Liner in Kizz & Tell + Dior Lip Glow in Rosewood — you just have to retouch the dior but this combo?! Such perfection! 👩🏼‍🍳😘 this is my nth stick of the lip liner kasi ito lang ginagamit ko every day of my life. Kinda wanna try the new shades pero amperfect na kasi ng kizz & tell soooo we’ll see.

I have acne prone and textured skin. Despite of that, I still want to achieve a fresh-clean girl look. I honestly don’t mind if my textured skin still shows, eh ganun talaga. 🤷🏻‍♀️

I used stretch concealer on my under eyes, nose, and side of lips. This is my first time using a pot concealer and I thought I will not like it cause I have combi skin. But surprisingly,  this is super lightweight. It can be buildable too as it was able to cover my redness. The finish is kinda dewy/glowy so I need to set it with powder. I really love the natural finish na parang wala lang akong inapply. And it lasts whole day for me! I get the hype on this one, sulit sya. 

I used generation g lipstick in the shade Jam for my cheeks and lips. For me, this is one of my best buy from them cause I can use this on my lids as well! This has matte finish and lives to its claim na blotted lip look. It feels soft on the lips and buildable too! I need to reapply though every time I eat.

I tried multiple skincare products from western, korean, japanese and etc. A year or 2  ago sa dami ko nilalagay sa mukha ko umabot din ako sa punto na nakakalimutan or tinatamad na ako mag lagay. Parang ang dami di ko na minsan nasusunod, so i decided to lessen and just stick to the basic skincare essentials. And Im so glad I did kasi it worked well with my skin.

OMG people have been sleeping on this, I kid you not this worked well with removing my eyebrow and lash mascara. Nagulat din ako when I used this for the first few months kasi for its price ha this is really worth it. Di rin sya drying after mawash off yung oil. I highly recommend this.

Facial cleanser

4 star kasi mejo expensive PERO small amount goes a long way! Grabe pang second bottle ko na to, nung naubos ko yung unang bottle ko sabi ko bili muna ako iba na di ganun ka pricey. Nag sisi ako mga memshie kasi hinanap ng skin ko yung Clinique, yung pinalit ko Snail deoproce kasi i heard good reviews about the brand kaso i was not happy with it. Parang feeling ko mejo harsh sya sa skin ko and madalas ako magkaroon ng maliliit na butlig. Kaya i decided to go back and I remembered how much my skin love this. 

It does not strip my skin dry, no banat feeling just feeling plump and hydrated. This does not foam that much but It cleans my face well and feeling ko eto na magiging holy grail ko, actually not feeling ITO na talaga the one ko.

5 star sya kahit pricey kasi worth the price sya. Actually eto yung reason but ko tnry yung facial wash. Backstory: nainspire kasi ako sa face ng mom ko haha. 70+ na sya pero maganda padin skin nya at never ko nakita mom ko nag break out, and isang moisturizer lang gamit nya for 30+ years and eto yun. Kaya sabi ko if it worked for my mom it might work for me too. So i took the plunge and bought one and this is my 3rd or 4th bottle? This is so good it does the job of moisturizing my face and never ako nag break out, well occasionally pag time of the month. But i really love this moisturizer it is a good investment.

Everything I wrote is based from my experience, knowledge from fellow redditors on r/AsianBeauty, r/SkincareAddiction, and A LOT of research. Always remember - **YMMV (Your Mileage May Vary)** - what worked for others might not work for you and vice-versa. There's no universal treatment in acne or other skin concerns. Skincare is a process of trial and error. Take this post with a grain of salt. 

Also, this is a lengthy post so if you don't have any patience to read this wall of text, shoo! (Ay ang hard haha). Seriously, this post is mostly composed of studies, anecdotes, and other references to support my claims. AYAW NATIN NG FAKE NEWS 'DI BA? 

For clarification, I'm far from that Korean, dewy skin. I have suffered from acne vulgaris for years, but I'm confident that my face improved a lot. But this post wouldn't focus with my acne journey. I want this to be a general skincare guide. There may be some personal thoughts here and there but that would be it. 

Lastly, I apologize if along the way I may have bent the rules of grammar. I'm just accustomed to explaining things in English. I might repeatedly edit this post if I could bring myself to thoroughly proofread this.

---

&nbsp;

While I know and appreciate that dermatologists know what products or practices are best for us especially our skin, I'm one of those enthusiasts who believe that it is much better if you know your OWN skin. For example, over my skincare journey I found out that my skin can't handle SLS but I can tolerate SLES, products with malunggay/ben oil break me out, etc. And these are findings a dermatologist can't just provide to me.

You'll probably get fed up with my skincare one liner - YMMV (Your Mileage May vary) - but this is crucial concept to be familiarized with. Everyone's skin is different. In a simple context - we have different sensitivity to cosmetic ingredients. YMMV but the components of our skin are all the same, just varies on how much you have vs how much they have.

Let me provide you with some science. I'll try to explain this simply (as the saying goes, know and befriend your enemy), tho of course jargon can't be avoided. 

&nbsp;

**A LITTLE SCIENCE ON HOW OUR SKIN WORKS**

&nbsp;

Our skin is composed of three layers - dermis, hypodermis, and epidermis. The most important of the three is the **epidermis** - the outer layer of the skin. Epidermis consists of 15-20 layers of cells which is mostly 95% of **keratinocytes**. They create proteins, with *Keratin* being the most major protein. They are made in the basal (deepest) layer of the epidermis - *Stratum basale/stratum germinativum*. Keratinoctyes present here undergo division and differentiation, half of it will remain in this basal layer, while the other half will further go upward into the upper layers until they reached the outermost layer of the epidermis - the **stratum corneum (SC)**. Keratinocytes in the SC are now keratinized or cornified, this is why they are also called Corneocytes. These keratinocytes in the SC or **corneocytes** are now dead skin cells, which regularly slough away (also called desquamation) and again replaced by Keratinocytes from the deeper layers. They are tightly bound together, forming the SC barrier (sometimes called epidermal barrier, moisture barrier), which plays an important role for a healthy skin.^[1,2]

This entire process of keratinization takes up to 4 weeks or approximately 28 days. 

Other cells present in the epidermis are:^[1,3]

- Melanocytes - they protect our skin from harmful uv rays through their pigment called *melanin*. This pigment is black in nature, that's why when our skin is excessively exposed to sun, such cells produce more melanin. More melanin = darker spot. Heh! Don't blame melanocytes; blame yourself for not applying sunscreen. :P
- Langerhans’ Cells - they uptake the antigens in our skin and carry them to the nearest lymph node. Specialized in fighting germs.
- Merkel Cells - enables us to sense pressure because of their sensory function. 

&nbsp; 

Notice how I focused with the Epidermis 'cause this is where skin diseases usually arise. I hope I haven't lost you yet. Skin actually involves complicated processes; the one I mentioned above is just a simplified version.

&nbsp;

Going back to stratum corneum (SC). SC is the most superficial layer of epidermis. It is also called 'horny layer' because *stratum corneum* is a latin term which literally translates to horny layer. 

And now the SC barrier. SC barrier is usually described through the *Bricks and Mortar* model. Construction of SC barrier resembles a wall in which layered *corneocytes* stand for *bricks*. Desmosomes keep them intact. Intercellular lipids are the cement which stand for *mortar*.^[2,4]

[Visualization](http://www.ajicjournal.org/cms/attachment/2006299184/2028507809/gr3.jpg)
 
These bricks main job is the SC's hydration. This is because of the presence of **natural moisturizing factors** (NMFs). NMFs provide moisture retention because of its humectant property. Humectant bonds with water molecules to increase water content in the skin. Some 
compounds also have the ability to attract moisture from the environment. NMFs are comprised of amino acids, carboxylic pyrrolidone acid, lactic acid, urea, glucose, and mineral ions.^[5-7]

The mortar, intercellular lipids, are mostly **ceramides** or sphingolipids (50%), remaining would be 25% of **cholesterol**, and 15% of **free fatty acids**. Together, they strengthen the permeability barrier, warding off external irritants; help in water retention and flux.^[8]


Also notice how important hydration (i.e. water content) in our epidermis, specifically in stratum corneum. 

Hold on, I'm not trying to sound r/imverysmart here. I assure you such information are significant in skincare. As we delve in further, you'll understand why.

&nbsp;

So how do you measure skin barrier function? It is through **transepidermal water loss (TEWL)** and water content of the stratum corneum, and **skin surface pH**. TEWL and water content are evidently inversely proportional - increased TEWL lowers water content; decreased TEWL more water content. TEWL is the total amount of water vapor loss through skin when there is no sweat gland activity. TEWL is measured by ServoMed Evaporimeter (VERY EXPENSIVE!).^[9-12]

Impaired barrier function has been known to lead in skin conditions and diseases such as xerosis (dryness), rosacea, atopic dermatitis (eczema), and acne vulgaris.^[10,13-15] It has been observed that patients with acne vulgaris have low amount of ceramides due to the diminished water barrier content, measured by TEWL. AV patients have higher sebum production and greater TEWL.^[16]

&nbsp;

*Oh, okay. Eh 'di ikaw na maraming alam, OP. Bakit hindi mo na lang kami diretsuhin sa acne treatments?!*

Aba aba, easyhan mo lang. This is one of my pet peeves. We want to have a healthy skin but we don't really educate ourselves with how our skin works, how  a specific product works - how it really impacts our skin. We just slather a random product on our skin and just hope for the best. Well, that 'best' doesn't come easily. We tend to follow unsolicited advice from people who are blessed with good genes and have a healthy skin to begin with. 

And if ever there's someone here, reading, who has a clear skin to die for, please stop giving UNSOLICITED advice. You're just bringing more attention to the person that they have problematic skin. Of course they know it, but rubbing it to them that they need to treat it isn't actually helpful at all.  

&nbsp;

'Kay, going back. 

&nbsp;

Let me state my side why when someone asks advice from me, I don't advise them to see dermatologist ASAP. Emphasis on ASAP. I don't want to sound like I'm discouraging people to visit dermatologist. 

*Insert situation where a patient went to dermatologist because of acne vulgaris*

A dermatologist would surely prescribe acne treatments. These can be topical or oral antibiotics;  oral Vitamin A derivative like Accutane; topical Vitamin A derivatives (also known as retinoids) like Tretinoin, Epiduo, Differin (Adapelene); benzoyl peroxide; salycilic acid; azelaic acid; and many more. ~~(YOU SEE, THERE ARE MANY TREATMENTS AVAILABLE AND YET WE STILL SUFFER FROM AV)~~. They would also insist you to use their products or prescribe OTC products, having a basic routine to support a treatment they chose for you.

By then, the patient already have a simple routine of cleanser, (toner), moisturizer, (and sunscreen) + maybe a topical treatment like Epiduo. The dermatologist advised the patient to use all of these consistently. 

Problems? MANY. First, there's no guarantee that the basic routine of cleanser, moisturizer, etc will work for your skin. Why? You can be sensitive to certain ingredient/s present on them, thus leading to *acne cosmetica* (breakouts from cosmetic products). Second, how the hell will you know if it's the cleanser, the toner, or the moisturizer that's causing the problem if you introduced them all at once? Third, treatments like Epiduo encourage faster skin cells turnover rate which can lead to *purging* (surfacing clogged pores A.K.A. it's gonna get worse before it gets better), how will you know if those added acne are due to purging and not acne cosmetica?


Fourth, these treatments can compromise our skin barrier. Benzoyl peroxide (BP) can cause irritant dermatitis and can result to TEWL.^[17] Topical retinoids can also cause dermatitis. In fact, there's a term called retinoid dermatitis - erythema (redness), scaling (dryness), and desquamation. ^[18] In short, no matter how powerful these treatments are, they can also worsen your skin concerns.


Quoting:

> In addition, certain medications used to treat AV can cause alterations in SC integrity and function, either via the active ingredient, the vehicle, or both, which can result in signs and symptoms of cutaneous irritation. . Providing specific skin care recommendations, including product selection and proper use, is an important part of the management of AV and may adjunctively augment the efficacy of topical medications in reducing acne lesions.^[19]

Yes, the patient's derma is right in providing a skin care products to help a treatment. But he's wrong for suggesting to use them all at once.

We have to keep in mind that a problematic skin has an impaired barrier function present to different conditions as what stated above.^[10,13-15] So damaging the skin barrier further would just worsen everything. 

&nbsp;

**SO what do you need to do, then? BABY your skin! Moisturize it. Strengthen your SC barrier.** 

&nbsp;

But how? By having a dedicated skincare routine! This is what I like with r/AsianBeauty. ABers focus on strengthening their skin barrier rather than treating any skin conditions right away. Try posting once on their daily help thread. ""Hi! I'm new to skincare and I need suggestions to treat my acne."" They wouldn't say ""Hello! Acids like chemical exfoliants are effective on treating acne, try..."" Their answers would probably be, ""What's your current routine? I suggest having a basic routine first before proceeding with powerful treatments.""

Because it makes sense! Having a dedicated skincare routine without treatment is as powerful as focusing on treatment itself.^[20,21]

Fun fact: Even a proper skincare routine has been known to be effective in aiding the skin barrier function of infants.^[22,23] ~~I can now foresee what would be the first product I would buy for my son/daughter - a moisturizer! Haha, kidding.~~ 

Believe me, when I started having a routine of cleanser + moisturizer + sunscreen every day, the number of my acne reduced significantly. But of course I reached the plateau where I needed to incorporate treatments on my routine, because having a solid routine + a powerful treatment would lead you far!^[24-26]

&nbsp;

A simple skincare routine shall compose of a gentle cleanser, a moisturizer, a broad-spectrum sunscreen.

Before we go further to skincare routine let me just provide additional notes to consider.

**YMMV (Your Mileage May Vary)**, duh. I know I mentioned this numerous times and will still do. It is important to instill this concept. You shouldn't be surprised that a certain, popular product didn't work for you. Or a product in which some told you to stay away from, worked for you. That's one of the mysteries of this world, Babe. ~~When they said we are created in God's image and likeness, they meant different gods~~. 

We have different sensitivities to ingredients present in a specific product. 

>""People can even be allergic to commonly used products. It’s not that ingredients in these are unsafe – it’s the way the body reacts to them can differ from person to person.""
Dr Chris Flower, Director-General of CTPA and a Chartered Biologist & Toxicologist^[27]

When a product says *hypoallergenic* doesn't guarantee one won't have reaction to it. After all, *hypo* means *less than* so just lesser chance of allergic reaction. 

Same goes with *non-comedogenic* (won't clog your pores). This is just one of those marketing strategies to make you buy that product. Okay, I might have gone overboard. That is still a useful guideline 'cause they could mean that the manufacturers tested their products and consider them good fit for people with oily, acne-prone skin. Don't get so worked up with this when you buy products tho. *""Okay, this one doesn't say non-comedogenic so I might get acne here*"". No, not that mindset. Remember what I said? YMMV. You won't know until you test it out yourself.

[FDA has a list of common claims and labels used in cosmetics](https://www.fda.gov/Cosmetics/Labeling/default.htm). 

These are:

- ""Alcohol Free""
- “Cosmeceutical”
- ""Cruelty Free""/""Not Tested on Animals""
- Hypoallergenic
- Organic

As you can see, non-comedogenic is not recognized by FDA.

One reason is the comedogenicity of some ingredients were tested on rabbit ears. NOT ON HUMANS. 

[Related reading](https://www.prettycat.uk/single-post/2017/09/12/Comedogenicity-testing--The-Rabbit-Ear-Test)


&nbsp;

From time to time, I'm gonna use cosdna.com as a reference to products' ingredients. It's a helpful site for identifying if a specific ingredient is highly comedogenic or an irritant. It does sound contradicting to my previous statement but even [CosDNA said that](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/help/ingredients_qna.php)

> Our data source include[sic] international experts, institutions and publications. If any the three column is blank, this meas[sic] there is no data (not indicate[sic] [whether] the ingredient is safe or unsafe). We want to remind our user, the effect of cosmetics depends on concentration, quality, process and mutual influence of ingredients. The skin condition of each person are[sic] different (even constantly changing).

Nevertheless, it still a good site to track ingredients of a particular product. If for example two products broke you out or gave you adverse reactions, you can look and compare the ingredients present on these products, and pinpoint what could be the culprit.

&nbsp;

That being said, **Don't hesitate to stop using a product that is not working for you.** If it's making things worse, that just means it's not meant for you. 

*Ahh maybe this product is just drawing these pimples out.* No, that is *skin purging* and purging, only happens when you're using exfoliants (BHA, AHA,etc), acids, and/or vitamin A topical derivatives which increase skin's cells turnover rate like retinoids. 

&nbsp;


**SKINCARE IS GENDER-NEUTRAL**

This is intended specifically to men. Taking care of your skin doesn't make you less masculine. Using at least three facial products won't hurt your manliness. Please stop that ongoing machismo. 

Those products labeled *for men* are just marketing bullshits. 

I'm not saying that there's no skin difference between men and women. In fact, males have been reported to have larger pore size and higher sebum production.^[28] Even the skin's pH (which will be tackled later) of females are lower compared to males.^[29] Males also have greater skin thickness than females.^[30]. Males also experience more intense pigmentation after sun exposure and retain it for a longer time than females.^[31]. 


&nbsp;

Let's have an example.

*Nivea for men deep cleansing face wash*

[Ingredients](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_e1ce27538.html)

> Aqua, **Cocamidopropyl Betaine**, **Sodium myreth sulfate**, **Decyl Glucoside**, Panthenol, Tocopheryl Acetate, **Alcohol Denat**, PEG-90 GLYCERYL ISOSTEARATE, **PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil**, Sodium Acrylates/c10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Polyquaternium-10, Laureth-2, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Propylparaben, Benzophenone-4, Parfum

Ingredients in bold are surfactants and an alcohol. What I have observed from cleansers that are marketed for men is its supposedly ""deep cleansing"" characteristic. This can be seen from these surfactants. I included alcohol because aside from these sulfates, this is also the culprit why it feel like such products *really cleanses* your face. When in reality, it just leaves your face squeaky clean and DRY. 

What I also observed is the presence of Benzophenone-4, why the hell would you put a sunscreen ingredient in a facial wash?? 

Now, knowing that men's skin has larger pores and tends to be more oily, do these ingredients really help with a male skin? Does science view surfactants as ingredients for men? 

Don't get me started with the other one - *Sikreto ng mga Gwapo*. ~~Sikreto pero binunyag, h'wag ako~~. Okay, I'm not saying avoid this product and the like. If it works for you, then okay. 

&nbsp;

Another example:

*Pond's Men Energy Charge All-in-One Moisturizer*

Wow what's with these ""men"" products that use ""Energy"" ""Fresh"" ""Sport"", ""Cool""? To make them more *masculine*? lol

[Ingredients](https://www.ponds.com/ph/men/products/collection/energy-charge/moisturizer.html)

> Water, Dimethicone, Alcohol Denat, Glycerin, Butylene Glycol, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/VP Copolymer, Caprylic/Capri Triglyceride, Ammonium Acryloyldimethyltaurate/Beheneth-25 Methacrylate Crosspolymer, Perfume, DMDM Hydantoin, Linoleamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride Phosphate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Disodium EDTA, Propylene Glycol, Stearic Acid, BHT, Menthol, Sodium PCA, Triethanolamine, Niacinamide, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate, Coffea Arabica (Coffee) Seed Extract, Coffea Robusta Seed Extract

Another thing I observed is that these manufacturers of supposedly ""for men"" products might be inclined to the idea that men prefer putting products that absorb easily, almost feel like nothing has been applied to the skin, have a cooling effect. 

These are evident with *Alcohol Denat* high up in the ingredients list. Alcohol, an astringent, makes the product absorb easily and can be irritating to some. The presence of Menthol, which is another astringent, is just for added fragrance and cooling sensation. And how can these be beneficial to male's skin? 

It's not that this particular moisturizer is not beneficial. Key ingredients such as *Niacinamide* - for skin brightening and sebum regulation, *Coffea Arabica (Coffee) Seed Extract, Coffea Robusta Seed Extract* - for anti aging and photoaged skin, are also present. The thing is these ingredients are way below the list. Perfume even listed ahead of them, in which sensitive skin peeps should be wary of. 

&nbsp;

Okay let me stop criticizing these products. The takeaway is - skincare is not sexist! The *for men* label is just a marketing ploy, tricking you into thinking that their products are specially formulated for men.

### A skincare routine that doesn't compromise our SC barrier

&nbsp;

**ON CLEANSERS / FACIAL WASHES**

&nbsp;

If you're going to visit r/AsianBeauty you might stumbled with the pH level of the cleanser they are using. Apparently, pH level is significant in choosing a cleanser to have a healthy skin barrier. 

**The pH (Potential of Hydrogen / Power of Hydrogen)** is a measure of the acidity or alkalinity of an aqueous solution.

[For reference](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-1fChGF6M8a4/Vxcq2iOIf_I/AAAAAAAAEv8/tqT54xF5wMcwSVVaqHBe8YROCx7wP6EVgCLcB/s1600/640px-216_pH_Scale-01.jpg]). The pH scale ranges from 0-14. The pH of distilled water is 7, this is neutral. Any solution with a pH below 7 is an acid and any solution with a pH above 7 is an alkali (or base).

The skin itself does not really have a pH. When they talk about the pH of the skin, they are referring to the pH of a very thin, naturally secreted, moist layer caused by normal secretions from sweat glands (sudoriferous glands), sebaceous glands (which secrete an oily substance called sebum), and the breakdown of fatty acids on the skin by good bacteria that live on our skin. Together these secretions create the **Acid Mantle**.

Yes, remember that I mentioned that skin's pH surface is one of the measures of skin barrier function?^[12] Well, it's gonna be relevant here!

Skin's surface pH is said to be ranging from 4 to 6. Some papers say anywhere from 4 to 7 pH level. Having an average of 4.7, 5.5.^[32,33] The consensus is that our skin's pH is acidic to slightly/mildly acidic. This pH level helps maintain the strength and cohesiveness of the skin.^[34]

Why is it important to maintain this level of acidity tho? The formation of barrier lipids is observed to be delayed when the pH level is 7.4 or alkaline in nature.^[35] Hope you still remember the SC barrier's mortar.^[8] Lipid formation and metabolism require an acidic pH; alterations contribute to the SC barrier's integrity which may lead to different skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis (Eczema), irritant contact dermatitis, ichthyosis, acne vulgaris, and Candida albicans infection.^[36]

Also, maintaining the skin's acidity doesn't disrupt the bacterial flora's (good bacteria) colonization, present on our skin. Whereas, reaching an alkaline pH promotes the dispersal of these bacteria.^[37] One example is the growth of  Propionibacterium acnes (P Acnes), a commensal bacterium found naturally on our skin, which is also one of the causes of acne vulgaris. P Acnes grow much better in an acidic environment, reaching alkaline pH can increase the number of P Acnes.^[38] Aside from these, alkaline pH skin can show severe irritation to ingredients such as sodium lauryl sulfate (a harsh detergent that we will talk about later).^[39]

It has also been observed that patients with acne vulgaris tend to have a higher skin pH in comparison to those who a normal skin. Majority of acne occurences are related to high skin pH. Further increase of this pH mirrors a state of SC instability.^[40]

&nbsp;


What increases our skin's pH? There are certain factors for that. Endogenous factors include: Skin moisture, sweat, sebum, anatomic site, genetic predisposition, race, age, atopic skin disease. Exogenous factors include: Soaps, detergents, cosmetic products, occlusive dressings, skin irritants, and topical antibiotics.^[41] We'll focus on the latter, with cleansers being the most significant. 

The use of high pH cleansers can disrupt the acid mantle by increasing its acidic pH.^[37,40] A study showed that using an acidic cleanser reduced the number of acne and caused little irritation to acne-prone patients, as oppose to the group who used a soap bar (with a relatively high pH) - number of acne increased.^[42] 

Ideally, cleansers should have a pH of around 5.5.^[43] Avoid using soap bars, not only because almost all of them are alkaline (high pH)^[44] , they are also harsh and bring greatest changes to the barrier. Opt for liquid facial cleansers instead.^[45] 

Ever wondered why some of feminine washes are formulated with acidic pH? (i.e. pH Care). ;)

How about the recently hyped Aztec Healing Clay Mask? Why is it combined with Apple Cider Vinegar (ACV)? Aztec's main ingredient is calcium bentonite clay which has a whooping pH level of 8 to 9.7! ACV has a pH level 3 to 5 - a perfect pH-neutralizer to bring down the bentonite clay's pH to an optimum skin pH level. 

&nbsp;


**You might want to avoid cleansers with SLS**

Probably the most common surfuctant is *sodium lauryl sulfate* (SLS) also known as sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). It is one of the cheap foaming agents commonly found on soaps, shampoos, toothpaste, etc. It is responsible for the foam or the rich lather you notice when you use such products.^[46]

Surfuctants can penetrate into skin and compromise SC barrier function.^[47] SLS, among other surfuctants, can increase the SC's TEWL and can cause inflammation.^[48,49] Ceramides, one of the skin's lipids^[8], has been observed to decrease when skin is in contact with SLS.^[50] 

It is also listed by [CosDNA](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/ebc959348.html), having a comedogenic rating of 5. 

&nbsp;

So TL;DR just choose a cleanser that is low pH and doesn't contain SLS then? NOT REALLY but IDEALLY yes. What I meant is there's a reason why some have nice skin despite using cleansers with high pH.  It's just that if you can avoid the drawbacks, then why not? But then again YMMV.

BUT if semantics aside, what you really need to consider is to make sure you're using a **GENTLE** cleanser. Your skin shouldn't feel tight after cleansing. Not drying. Not that ""squeaky clean"" feeling as what others coin.  Just because you're oily, you're gonna tolerate that. No. Remember that I mentioned that sebum is one of the components of acid mantle? That squeaky clean feeling is removing this fatty layer which is important part of skin's natural protection, and stripping natural oils instead of excess oils.

Avoid overwashing, too. Cleanse for a maximum of two times only. Some even like to just splash plain water in the morning. I know it's tempting to wash your face, especially for oily skin, but that's just a temporary fix. After a few minutes, you'll notice that oils will start to build up again. You might even get *acne detergicans* from overwashing. If it bothers you that much, I recommend having an oil face blotter instead which only removes excess oils. [Like this one from Clean & Clear](https://www.cleanandclear.com/blotting-papers/clean-clear-oil-absorbing-sheets)

&nbsp;

I'm gonna list some IDEAL facial washes you can choose from. If I missed other ones, especially LOCAL cleansers or easily available, please do comment.

**[Human Heart Nature] Facial Washes**

[Months ago, I asked Human Heart Nature through their page the pH levels of their various cleansers](https://imgur.com/a/DPcKZ). They were pretty responsive. Listing them down.

- [Nourishing Facial Wash](https://humanheartnature.com/buy/index.php/facial-lip-care/nourishing-facial-wash.html) has a pH level of 4.50 to 5.2
- [Hydrating Creamy Wash](https://humanheartnature.com/buy/index.php/facial-lip-care/hydrating-creamy-wash.html) has a pH level of 4.0 to 6.0
- [Balancing Facial Wash](https://humanheartnature.com/buy/index.php/balancing-facial-wash.html) has a pH of 4.0 to 6.0
- [Acne Defense Facial Wash](https://humanheartnature.com/buy/index.php/facial-lip-care/acne-defense-facial-wash-100ml.html) has a pH of 4.0 to 5.0

Personally,I prefer the Nourishing Facial Wash. It does what a cleanser should do - gentle cleansing. You might ask why not the Acne Defense Facial Wash since I have oily acne-prone skin type? My understanding is cleanser should only cleanse not treat your acne with acne-fighting ingredients. It's because cleanser is not meant to stay on our skin for a few minutes, thus such ingredients would not really contribute to acne. But if it works for some, go! If you want to try these facial washes, each of these has a small variant for a cheap price. Perfect for testing before committing to full sized bottles. 

Keep in mind that the surfuctants on these cleansers are not strong and little to no emulsifier present, thus you *might* not notice a rich foam or lather but that doesn't mean it's not doing it's job. Don't use a huge blob just to force a lather. These are also not fragrance-free. 

&nbsp;

**[[Celeteque Dermoscience] Hydration Facial Wash](https://www.unilab.com.ph/products/celeteque-dermoscience-hydration-facial-wash/)**

Quoting the product's description:
> It has mild cleansing agents and a special combination of moisturizers that gently yet effectively clean without drying your skin.

And according to one redditor who used digital pH meter to test the pH level of different cleansers, this one has a pH of 5.5! [Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/63jk7a/psa_ph_levels_of_various_cleansers/)

Has SLES - a milder version of SLS. I do like this one tho even my mom and my lil sis. Fragrance-free.

&nbsp;

**[Sebamed] Facial Cleansers**

Has two variants: 

- [for oily and combination skin](http://www.sebamed.com/products/product-page/?tx_sebamedproducts_productlist%5Bproduct%5D=124&tx_sebamedproducts_productlist%5Baction%5D=show&tx_sebamedproducts_productlist%5Bcontroller%5D=Product&cHash=33d05c27ea2ee6871e84e36fdd0a39e4)
> Soap-free facial cleanser with the pH value of 5.5 of healthy skin to remove excess sebum and aid the skin achieving lipid balance of oily and combination skin

- [for normal to dry skin](http://www.sebamed.com/products/product-page/?tx_sebamedproducts_productlist%5Bproduct%5D=125&tx_sebamedproducts_productlist%5Baction%5D=show&tx_sebamedproducts_productlist%5Bcontroller%5D=Product&cHash=62e9f9649f6166184bb8da0635908ac3)
> Soap-free facial cleanser with the pH value of 5.5 of healthy skin to support and maintain the moisture and lipid balance of normal to dry skin

The cleansers look promising. I haven't tried them out tho.

&nbsp;

**[[Belo Essentials] Facial Washes](http://beloessentials.ph/product)**

- *Pore Minimizing Facial Wash*

> For smooth and radiant complexion, start with Belo Essentials Pore Minimizing Face Wash that tightens pores and whitens your skin in just 7 days! This soap-free, gentle cleanser contains Glutathione, Kojic Acid, and Gigawhite to whiten and skin vitamins to moisturize, revitalizing your skin with a radiant glow. Expertly formulated for oily skin.

It has a pH level of 5.3.

- *Skin Hydrating Facial Wash*

> Your first step to whiter skin, Belo Essentials Skin Hydrating Face Wash deeply cleanses without over-drying and whitens your skin in just 7 days! This soap-free, nourishing cleanser is infused with Glutathione, Kojic Acid, and Gigawhite to whiten and skin vitamins to moisturize, revealing clearer and whiter skin. Expertly formulated for normal to dry skin.

It has a pH level of 5.4.

Personal thoughts: The ""whitens your skin in just 7 days"" seems bogus. You can't just ""whiten"" your skin for that span. And expecting that from a cleanser? Nah. Anyway, if you're looking for a cleanser that's no-frills, these are not for you. They have tons of ingredients present.


&nbsp;


**[[Safeguard] Derma Sense Facial Cleanser Sensitive Variant](http://www.sampleroom.ph/safeguard-derma-sense-gently-cleanses-facial-cleanser-acne-prone-skin)**

> gently cleanses easily irritable skin with its mild, unscented formula. It removes dirt, impurities and excess oil, while maintaining your skin's natural layer. Dermatologically tested, DERMA SENSE brings professional care right to you

Also pH-balanced. I freaking want to try this one because it's well loved by fellow redditors here, but it's always out of stock! Yes, if a product is labeled for sensitive skin, I always prefer it because of their clean ingredients list (no fragrance, additives,etc), so less chance of breaking me out.

&nbsp;

**[[Himalaya] Purifying Neem Face Wash](http://www.himalayaherbals.com/products/skincare/Purifying-Neem-Face-Wash.htm)**

> Specially formulated to give you clear, problem free skin, a soap-free, daily use face wash gel that cleanses your skin by removing excess oil and impurities without over-drying. Neem, well-known for its purifying and antibacterial properties, kills problem-causing bacteria. Combined with Turmeric, it helps control acne and pimples leaving your skin soft, clear, refreshed and problem-free.

According to some redditors it has a pH level of 5.5.

&nbsp;

**[[Cetaphil] Gentle Skin Cleanser](https://www.cetaphil.com/gentle-skin-cleanser)**

> a mild, non-irritating formulation that soothes skin as it cleans. In fact, it's gentle enough for a baby's delicate skin. Designed specifically to work for all skin types, it is a simple, yet highly effective way to care for your skin.

This one has SLS. But my best friend uses this one and she really likes it! She said it's like putting a lotion on her face. Unfortunately, this broke me out. I can't handle SLS. It is also popular on r/AB and r/SCA. 

[Ingredients](http://cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_7019242376.html)

If you can tolerate SLS, this is a perfect cleanser for you. Very short ingredients list. But I've read somewhere this has a pH of around 6.7. Not alkaline so it's kinda good nevertheless.

&nbsp;


**ON MOISTURIZERS**

&nbsp;

This is probably the most vital part of skincare. Moisturizers can help with our SC barrier function if proper ingredients are used. From TEWL reduction, skin lipids' restoration, and other skin rejuvenation benefits.^[51]

All skin types need moisturizer. Yes, that is contrary to the popular belief that oily skin doesn't need moisturizer. You just need to find a moisturizer that will suit your needs. I presume you already know what your skin type is. If still not, I suggest reading this **[informative post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianBeauty/comments/4kufkk/skin_basics_181_skin_types_setting_standards/)** 

**Skin types** vary in different measures but the most common would be: Normal (please step out, jk), Oily, Dry, Combination, and Sensitive. ([Paula's Choice recognizes that everyone has sensitive skin](https://www.paulaschoice.com/expert-advice/skincare-advice/basic-skin-care-tips/what-is-my-skin-type.html)).

&nbsp;

There are different types/components/classes/properties of moisturizers. These are humectants, emolients, occlusives, and constituents of natural moisturizing factor/essential proteins.^[52,53] 

**Humectants**, as mentioned earlier,^[6] attract water from two sources - from the dermis into the epidermis and in humid conditions from the environment. In short, they are responsible for hydration! However, humectants are a double-edged sword. They increase TEWL too by enhancing water absorption from the dermis into the epidermis where it is easily lost to the environment.^[53] In simplest words, because humectans increased the water content, the skin now have enough water so the rest just evaporates! For this reason, humectants are best combined with occlusives.

**[Some ingredients that act as a humectant](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4885180/table/T3/)**:^[54,55]

- *Glycerol/Glycerin*

This is the most common humectant. In fact, it is the second most frequently used cosmetic ingredient, next to water, documented through the FDA’s Voluntary Cosmetic Reporting Program.^[56] Glycerin is a skin-replenishing and restoring ingredient, meaning it is a substance found naturally in skin, helping to establish normal balance and hydration.^[57] 

- *Hyaluronic Acid (HA) or hyaluronan/Sodium Hyaluronate*

They are not actually the same. Sodium Hyaluronate is derived from Hyaluronic Acid but they still function the same.^[58] It is also present on our body and most abundant in our skin, which accounts for 50% of our body’s total HA level.^[59,60] It can hold 1000 times its water weight!^[61] This makes it a superstar ingredient in skin's hydration and even in skin aging.^[62-64]

- *Propylene Glycol(PG) and Butylene Glycol (BG)*

I've been seeing these ingredients mostly from sheet masks, which is pretty logical. PG and BG, not only a humectant, but can also act as an enhancer. They help active ingredients penetrate the skin.^[65,66] So from a few minutes a sheet mask stayed from your face, the ingredients present penetrated better on your skin; thus faster result (i.e. brightening). There are also studies concerning that PG is skin-sentisizing (can cause adverse reactions from repeated exposure).^[67-69] But the consensus seemed to be PG is safe to use in cosmetics.^[65] If anything, PG should be used in low concentrations^[69] just like other humectants.^[55]

- *Panthenol (Vitamin B5)*

Panthenol, in long-term use, significantly improved the moisture level and decreased TEWL of the skin.^[70,71] It is incredibly useful in wound healing, too.^[72]

- *Urea*

*Insert biased praises in this ingredient.* I just recently discovered this ingredient and I'm already in love. Urea? EWW. Don't worry it's a different urea when used in cosmetics. We are talking about hydroxyethyl urea. As you've read earlier, Urea is one of the natural moisturizing factors present in our skin.^[7]

Apparently, Urea is a well-known ingredient in treating xerosis (dry skin).^[73-75] As it turns out, it can also be beneficial to other skin types! Who said only dry skin needs that hydration?
Urea, like other humectants, can increase the hydration and water-binding capacity of the horny layer.^[76,77] It reduces TEWL and the irritant reactions when skin is exposed to SLS.^[78,79] 

This sexy ingredient has also been observed to have a keratolytic property!^[80,81] **Keratolytic** means the agent that assists keratolysis - ""the softening and shedding of the horny outer layer of the skin"".^[82] In other words, it helps with the desquamation of keratinocytes in the SC or corneocytes; or in more simpler term: *exfoliation*. Fear not, it gently exfoliates compare to active chemical exfoliants. The fun doesn't stop as Urea can also enhance the penetration of other topical ingredients.^[81,83,84]

&nbsp;

**Occlusives** sit on the skin, creating a physical barrier, blocking the TEWL in the SC. This is the reason why humectants are paired with occlusives. The former draws water onto the skin, while the latter traps this water. The most popular occlusive ingredient is **petrolatum** or petroleum jelly. At a minimum concentration of 5%, it can reduce TEWL by more than 98%!^^[54] 

But you all know how greasy a petroleum jelly is, right? Petroleum Jelly (Vaseline), was previously labeled as highly comedogenic after testing on rabbit's ear. But this has been busted by a study that tested it on acne-prone patients. They concluded that greasiness doesn't equate with comedogenicity! ""The admonition for acne patients to seek ""oil-free"" skin care products has no scientific merit with regard to comedogenicity.""^^[85] If a product is making you oily because of its nature, doesn't make it highly comedogenic.  But of course -.  There was also an issue that occlusives futher impair barrier function but it has been proven that occlusives, like petrolatum, even accelerated barrier recovery.^[86] I can attest to that. Petroleum jelly really helped when I overexfoliated my skin.

Because of aesthetic reasons, lighter occlusives came into picture like **lanolin, mineral oil**, and **silicones** which only reduce TEWL by 20–30%.^[54]

Just look at how our fellow redditors are fond of occlusives A.K.A. **S L U G  L I F E**

[I didn't choose the Slug life, the Slug life chose me.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/73t814/humor_i_didnt_choose_the_slug_life_the_slug_life/.)

[To all the slugs out there, you win](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/7xe07s/personal_to_all_the_slugs_out_there_you_win/)


&nbsp;

**Emolients** fill the gap between the layered corneocytes, smoothing the skin. This is the sticky feeling you notice on your moisturizer.

enigma beauty - first, the packaging is unique, pero medyo mahirap tanggalin yung cap. shade match definitely not perfect unlike with my issy skin tint. i got medium beige but medyo darker siya on me but i made it work naman. 

full coverage, i dont use concealer na on this kasi ganon siya ka full coverage. on the thicker side compared to maybelline lumi matte, so you have to work faster sa pag-blend and need iportion yung pag-apply kasi nagseset agad. light weight and i can say it held up naman sa buong shift ko. it doesn't oil up that much and di rin nag dry sa usual dry parts ng face ko. in my experience, di naman siya nag-ooxidize. the finish is nice and i did not use a setting spray and di rin ako nagretouch all day. for context, i have combination skin. would i repurchase? yes. pero hoping to get more shades.

colourette lip screen - medyo natatakot ako sa packaging kasi feel ko manipis siya and baka magleak. pero sabi naman ni ms nina, nag leak test na sila and it does not leak, period. i prefer this over sunnies' kasi i feel like mas hydrating siya, hindi siya nag-sisit lang sa lips mo na glossy and cutesy lang. it's moisturizing pero hindi malagkit, plus may spf pa. would i repurchase? yes!

careline lip oil - first time ko gumamit ng lip oil ever so di ko siya macompare. it's lightweight, di rin malagkit and pigmented din naman siya. it looks good on the lips pero ang bilis mawala.and magdry. would i repurchase? no.

happy skin lip cloud matte lip stick - i think im late na sa review dito and phase out na rin ata yung product? pero i found a reseller on shopee so i bought it. ive been looking for the perfect red lippie so i got the shade obsessed. one thing about this is it's very pigmented, one swipe lang and you're good. medyo drying pero it's matte so expect mo na yan, but definitely less drying compared to maybelline. would i repurchase? yes, pag on sale lol. i think there are better matte lippies out there na budget friendly.

careline filter primer - does it's job and super budget friendly. will definitely repurchase kapag out of stock ulit si vice co primer.

Current faves:

maybelline lumi matte + happy skin matte setting spray + sunnies face powder / absidy powder = fresh lang all day. kahit sobrang init and pawis ka fresh ka pa din tignan. been using this for a month and i can say na hulas and commute friendly tong combo na to. did a wear test din sa isang festival and ir stayed for more than 12 hours, fresh pa din yung base ko. medyo expensive lang talaga si happy skin setting spray pero it's definitely worth it lalo na if you commute a lot or go to events, antayin niyo na lang mag payday sale.",https://i.redd.it/u2a1u4g6yzue1.jpeg,242,64,Review,"colourette, cloud, sunnies, happy skin, issy, vice, enigma, careline, maybelline, mac","local, local, local, local, local, local, local, local, international, international","concealer, primer, powder, setting spray, skin tint",shopee,2025-04-15,Neutral

Things you’ll need:
- 20-pan Magnetic Makeup Palette from Laz (₱132, but you can get this cheaper if you have coins)
- cosmetic spoon or if you have the metallic spatula
- tissue. Madaming tissue 
- blowdryer or hair iron

Tips / notes:
- dont forget to take note of the shade names! I wasnt able to take note of the True Satin shades since tinapon ko na agad yung packaging
- it’s best to warm up the matte shades before transferring to the pan. Maybe because it’s matte so ang dry nya, nasisira yung lipstick when transferring
- the blowdryer is optional, gusto ko lang smooth sya sa pan
- if you’re using blowdryer, use scissors to hold the pan in place
- mas maganda if you use hair iron para walang spillage. Yung magnetic pan mismo yung umiinit so even yung distribution ng lipstick

Base products:
✨Dior Forever Skin Glow (shade 2N): Yes HG agad, the best foundation I’ve tried so far 😩 it doesn’t cling to my skin texture and doesn’t crease sa laugh lines/undereye lines. It also lasts the whole day even with just a finishing powder (no setting spray or loose powder).

- Happy Skin Serum Concealer (shade Cream Beige): For spot correcting ko ginagamit. Di rin ako nagkaka tiny bumps. But medium coverage lang.

✨ Nars Creamy Concealer (shade Vanilla): The only one that worked for brightening my dark undereyes with fine lines. Di rin nagcicrease :))

- Clio Mini Mesh Glow Cushion foundation (shade 03 Linen): Mid lang performance niya for me. Pero I included it here for the aesthetic 😂

- Issy Skin Tint (shade Beech): Okay lang siya and feels moisturizing, pero humuhulas kapag more than 6 hours na (even tho nag skin prep at set ako ng makeup).

Powder (di ko nasama sa pic lol):
✨Absidy Complexion Blur Translucent Powder (shade oat): True to its claims of blurring the pores and it blends sa makeup so well :)) 

Blush:
- Apieu Juicy Pang Water Blush (forgot if PK01 or PK03 Hehe basta pink siya): I like the strawberry scent and yung lapat niya sa skin ko. Mukhang natural glow and long-lasting. Pero often di na kita sa photos na blushed face ko. 

✨ Fwee Blurring Pudding Pot (shade Feel’n): Long-lasting and easy to blend sa cheeks. 

Lips:
- Nature Republic Honey Melting Lip Balm (02 Fig and 04 Pomegranate): maganda naman and not too sticky (better than Rom&nd’s melting balm IMO)

✨Peripera Ink Moody Glow Tint (shade Follow Rose): the only lip tint that worked on my dry lips 😂

- Nivea lip balm spf 15: buttery and non-drying

✨Dior Rouge Lipstick (shade 720 Icone): Chef’s kiss!

Eyes/Brows:
-Pretty Secret nude eyeshadow palette: pigmented and easy to use.

-Shawill eyeshadow palette (pink shades): pigmented and easy to use.

✨Issy Brow Detailing Pen (ash brown): very fine tip.

Madalang lang din kasi sila mag-sale ng bongga online kaya i thought chance na 'to para masubukan ko na finally products nila but oh well, mukhang mapapatagal pa bago ako makabili 🤧

175e6lt,"High-End makeup that's worth the splurge? Tried searching on this subreddit pero outdated na mga threads :(

I'm starting to build my makeup essentials and I want to buy highend na for my staples. So far, I bought these during 10.10 sale kasi ang laki ng nakuha kong discount:

* Charlotte Tilbury - Airbrush Flawless Finish Powder
* Charlotte Tilbury Setting Spray
* Benefit Boi ing Cakeless Concealer (tried a sample before and loved it!)
* Not makeup, but Estee Lauder ANR Serum (tried a smaller size and loved it too)

I'm eyeing the following:

* NARS Powder Blush - on the fence lang ako rito kasi nung swinatch ko sa mall, parang hindi pigmented? Or baka hindi lang talaga Orgasm shade ko
* Rare Beauty Liquid Blush - can't decide which shade because I'm afraid na baka maging orange-y din sa balat ko.
* Dior Lip Gloss - is this even worth it huhu

1lql90i,"Napabayaan ang sarili in my 20s. Trying to bounce back now (30F) I feel like I lost myself in my 20s. Training & career took over everything. No sleep, bad eating, no movement, vices, bad mental health… I just stopped caring for myself.

Sa totoo lang, maganda naman dapat ako haha. But stress really pushed me to the edge. Acne, dry hair, weight gain, weak body, you name it. There were times that I didn’t even want to look at myself in the mirror.

Now that I left the toxicity, I’m healing and trying to be better at self-care.

Here’s what I do now:

* **Hydration + better food choices:** I actually crave veggies & avoid fried food now? Mature yarn
* **Exercise & calorie deficit:** I try to hit 7.5k steps a day and do 2-3 workouts/week. But ang hirap ng cal def as a tiny person.
* **Dental care:** Especially flossing!!!
* Slowly building a **skincare/haircare routine** with products na hiyang for me. We always pay attention to our skin, but don’t neglect the scalp! Fave products right now are LRP moisturizer (w/c has SPF) & Dove Dermacare Scalp. I feel fresh kahit commuter. 🥹 Working on incorporating actives into my routine.

Mahirap lang maging consistent at umiwas sa hyped products on soc med hehe. But we’re getting there.

1kr8tos,"Body Care for Plus-sized Girl **QUICKFX Vita Sunscreen** *[SPF50 PA+++]*

P499 for 200mL. This has been my day-to-day body sunscreen so far. There are times na I use it for my face but mostly for body talaga. Claims are non-sticky and fast-absorbing; I find them to be true naman.


**Equate Ultra Sunscreen** *[Broad Spectrum SPF50]*

9-10 usd (ata) for 470 ish mL. This has been a pleasant surprise for me, although, it's unfortunate na hindi siya local. But yeah, consistency-wise, ang weird na para siyang sunscreen na hindi mable-blend nang mabilis or magl-leave ng whitecast...pero it's the opposite talaga.

Water resistant for 80 mins: I haven't checked if 80 mins exactly pero for my coron trip and my hiking trip (both last month lang nangyare), siya yung gamit ko. Very sportsy, outdoorsy-friendly na sunscreen. 

I also love its tropical scent hehe. 


**Luxe Organic Whitening Repair Ultra Light Glow Toner** *[Niacinamide, Licorice Extract, Arginine]*

P349 for 150mL. I mostly use this toner for my underarms — effective kasi when it comes to keeping it smooth and free from body odor. Parang bonus point nalang na evened out yung skin tone. I use this as well sa butt cheeks, inner thighs and underboobs. 

It's been 2 years or so na rin na ginagamit ko siya.


**Luxe Organix Intensive Whitening Underarm Cream** *[10% Niacinamide, Alpha Arbutin, Tranexamic Acid, Licorice Extract]

P299 for 40mL. I use this right after the LO toner. Also, I'm not sure bakit cream ang tawag sa kanya pero more like serum yung consistency niya. Same exact sentiments with the toner na I use this mainly to address yung body odor (underarms and underboobs). 

I wouldn't really say na nakakaputi siya per se. So that was definitely misleading. Brightening/even out the skin, though? Yes.

Also, may unique tangy but refreshing smell itong underarm cream and yung toner. Usually, ayaw ko yung strong perfume-y scent ng Luxe Organix pero I like talaga yung scent nitong dalawang products.


**WATSONS Aloe Hydrating After Sun Soothing Body Gel**

P209 for 100 mL. Very simple and straightforward na product - I use it as a soothing gel after a day na I've had more prolonged exposure sa sun. Or whenever certain areas of my body are red from heat/friction. Like kapag buong araw akong naka-bra and may red marks na yung band ng bra ko sa underboobs ko.


**Hello Glow All-Natural Papaw Balm**

P165 for 25g. I initially use this for lips lang talaga. And personally, siya pinaka-effective na lip balm. Simple and straightforward na product as well. 

However, I've learned through my sister na she would use this as an actual all-in-one balm. Specifically, sa mga dry patches niya all over her body. And it worked the same sa akin. I'm being careful nalang sa pag gamit to observe proper hygiene pa rin syempre hihi.


**Luxe Organix Bye Bye Bum Bumps White and Clear Booty Cream** *[AHA-BHA, Niacinamide, Cupuacu Butter]*

P229 for 230g. Newest favorite from LO!!! Paubos na actually ito pero first buy palang naman yang nasa pic. Sobrang bangooooooo—smells like natunaw na vanilla ice cream. I practically use it everywhere sa body: butt cheeks, inner thighs, underarms, underboobs. 

Medyo di ako sure kung may significant na brightening effects siya pero I do know na effective siya against texture (esp if acne related).


**Snake Brand Wild Thanaka Prickly Heat Cooling Powder** *[Anti-acne & Brighter Skin]*

P75 for 50g. Ever since, hindi talaga ako mahilig sa body care products in powder form. Pero I'm convinced well by this one. Effective sa cooling sensation. It doesn't necessarily last long pero it's fairly okay for instant relief. 

I used this sa mga outdoorsy activities ko last month. And even if bulky, boxy container siya, tinatyaga kong dalahin just to re-apply. 

I even use this sa face ko—and it didn't even break me out. 


**DR. SENSITIVE Sweat Shield Antiperspirant Deodorant Roll On** *[3% Niacinamide, Alpha Arbutin]*

P149 for 50 mL. Been using this for 3-4 consecutive nights na so it's the newest addition sa body care ko. Bibili ko ito last week when I remembered na ni-review ni Jan Angelo sa tiktok haha. 

Personally, yung go-to roll on deo ko, which was not included in this picture (naubos na), was the only deo/antiperspirant na hindi nag cause ng pangingitim ng kilikili. But this one, so far, didn't cause one as well. Very promising alternative for my go-to deo. 

Siguro, I would follow-up nalang eventually if it's something na could be effective rin against intense ish physical activity.",https://i.redd.it/wrqm4tvdoy1f1.jpeg,240,46,Review,dr. sensitive,local,"powder, lip balm",tiktok,2025-05-20,Neutral

Clarified as well if okay lang ba na binebenta pa rin yung product since may ganitong notice ang FDA about it.

1kn3qbj,"Weaponizing my oiliness with inner glow blush technique These days even my best performing bases cannot handle this heat, lalo na when I need to walk even for a bit. Tanggap ko na I'm gonna oil, so lately I've been trying to achieve Korean inner glow blushes, at least for my cheeks. I've been getting compliments so nakakakilig, and avoiding the heavy bases and blushes have helped me avoid patchy or cakey makeup kaya di ako masyado nacoconscious. 

  
Here are some fairly affordable products I can recommend. 

First though, go for sheer transparent blushes. This way parang two step process na lang gagawin to achieve a glow. Then use a watery type or wet look highlighter. I recommend Veecci Highlighter Stick. It's a way more affordable version of the chanel or hince glow balm. 



If you opt to go bare skin:

* Barenbliss 
* EB lip and cheek stain
* EB Blush Rush



If you have skin tint or foundation on:

* House of Hur moist ampoule blusher
* Son & Park color balm
* IPKN tone cushion blusher 



You can use powder or more opaque/matte cream blushes rin naman, but I don't want anything heavy and opting for these I risk my makeup getting cakey within the day:

* Use a liquid illuminator
* glowy blushes like the EB pillow pop dreamy sakura or marble blushes like spotlight marble blush
* White or clear highligher to add sheen



In my photo, I had bare skin and used EB stain plus veecci highligher lang. Still working on this technique, pero I'm absolutely loving the effect.

1fd0f05,"CT products review 
Hey guys,

An acquaintance happened to give me an employee discount for Charlotte Tilbury. A 30% off on everything so I happily bought to try their highly-rated setting spray, cream bronzer, and finishing powder. 

I’m using Milani setting spray, Chanel cream bronzer, and Hourglass ambient lighting powder as everyday makeup but I want separate products to use for work and for going out. 

So here’s my first impression of it:


* The setting spray. I didn't expect to love this. But wow, this makes my makeup last. I’m combo oily so I was really surprised to see I still have colors on my face even after 8 hours. You see, idk why but my face tends to kainin any cheek products after a few hours. Doesn't matter lahit long wearing pa Yan. So color me surprised when I still see some on my cheeks. 

Now, is it enough to replace my beloved Milani? Yes and No. Yes, kasi it has a finer mist compared to Milani so when I spray it onto my face Hindi basang bass because I love drenching my face with setting spray (is it just me tho?). No, kasi it’s hella expensive to use as an everyday product, and since I use tons. Sidenote: my Milani has seen me through a 12-hour busy shift as a nurse so tried and tested ko sya for heavy-duty talaga. As in walang hulas makeup and even after a 14-hour wear. So I’ll reserve using my CT setting spray for going out only. 


* CT cream bronzer. I got the shade medium and just perfect for me. It’s easy to blend naman just like my Chanel one. I don’t have any complaints about it tho. I find my Chanel is more subtle in bringing warmth to my face which I like it more since it looks more natural. I find onti lang naman difference nya, I think. I got it cheaper (so to speak)so this will be my work makeup. 


* CT finishing powder. Ohhh, another surprise! It lives up to its name, it makes my makeup look airbrushed. Lakas maka fresh! It doesn’t make my face look powdery or cakey even after piling my face with tons of products. So will I repurchase? Yes definitely. Can I see a difference between Hourglass and CT? Hmm yes. Hourglass ambient lighting powder gives a very natural finish. 

So here’s me right after putting on my makeup and in natural light and the next photo is me after 10 hours taken in the bathroom at 9 pm. I only did a very light touch-up with powder once on my nose and forehead area by mid-afternoon. After 10 hours, my T zone is a bit oily, the foundation still intact albeit with a slight breakup around my nose area, and the blush and bronzer still visible (which is a feat in itself, swear!) I still have that healthy glow even after, dewy but not oily!  

Disclaimer lang, I live in the Middle East and it’s summer rn. I stayed indoors and can’t speak for it’s commute-proof. 


*makeup product used: 
Dusted my T zone area with **RCMA no color loose powder** then sprayed with **CT setting spray**. Placed the **CT flawless filter** at the top of my cheekbone, blended then applied **Lancome teint idole ultra wear foundation**. **Huda beauty faux filter corrector** shade cherry blossom on my inner corner (for brightening) and peach for color correcting my undereye Then **Dior Forever concealer**, and set it with **Givenchy prisme libre** in shade 3. **Nars afterglow liquid blush and powder** in shade behave. **CT cream bronzer** and set it with **Gucci powder bronzer**. I contoured my nose with **Fenty skin stick** and set it with **Kevyn Aucoin contour powder**.  Set my face with **Givenchy prisme libre** in shade 4. Spray again with CT setting spray. Then finish it with **CT airbrush finishing powder** and **Skindinavia finishing spray**. 

Eyes: **Natasha Denona I need a nude eye palette** lined with **teviant eyeliner**. Lashes used are **lashify** in fluffy. Colored my brows with **Benefit brow powder** and laminated it with **got2b gel** (it’s a hair gel but I saw an MUA before using it for the brows).  

Lips: lined with Mac lipliner and lipstick used is **Givenchy le rouge sheer velvet** (I got this as a mini as a complimentary gift) the Givenchy is another surprise. I only touched it up twice today and it leaves a natural stain on the lips and glides on smoothly when applied. It’s matte but sheer hence the name. Will buy the full size once I run out of it.

Sometimes I do use gel brow if sinisipag ako lol. So, I want to upgrade my routine and decided to buy a skintint, yung recommended ngayon sa tiktok na Maybelline Skintint.

- MAC Baked Mineral Blush: Flirting with Danger
Love the color, no hulas din hanggang pag-uwi may blush pa din.

- Vice All Day Definition Contour: Latte Brown
I use this as eyeshadow para lang hindi flat tingnan yung eyes. Hindi din siya pang-contour kasi warm undertone, mas pwede pa na bronzer.

- Vice Soft Pearlescent Highlighter: Rosé
Minsan ginagamit ko din as eyeshadow.

- Vice Endlezz Universal Fix Baked Setting Powder: Natural
Ok for me kasi hindi nagmumukhang nilagyan ng harina yung mukha after. Very sheer lang ng coverage, but not so much on the oil control.

- So Natural Makeup Setting Fixx Spray: Real Matte
I love the nozzle, very fine yung mist. True to it's claim din sa oil control. 4 hrs lang dati super oily na ng t-zone, ngayon di na ko nagreretouch sa labas.


Eyes:

- Strokes Brow Sculptor Duo: Ash Grey & Warm Brown
Love the formula, easy to blend and budge proof.

15sl4br,"A few thoughts on the Filipino makeup scene. For context, I’m a twenty-five-year-old who’s been obsessed with makeup since I was fifteen (not quite a positive statement, I know). I’ve spent most of my adolescence buying makeup from high-end brands, thinking they were my only options if I wanted high-quality makeup.

I’m sure a lot of you remember how, ten years ago (and even further back than a decade), the local makeup scene was dismal, consisting of “low-tier” brands with extremely limited base makeup shade ranges at best and outright poorly-formulated cosmetics at worst. At least, that’s how the landscape looked like for me.

But, like most people, I lost interest in makeup during the pandemic. I gave most of it away and dipped out of the makeup scene. Today, I’m slowly regaining my interest in makeup again, and I’m glad to see local brands burgeoning into what it’s become. These days, I see a lot of strong contenders, namely GRWM, Issy, and Strokes. I know there are a ton more, especially ones that existed before the pandemic, like Happy Skin, BLK, Colourette, and Pili Ani, and, of course, decades-old staples like Ever Bilena and Features & Shades. I only mentioned the first three brands, though, because they’re the brands I see the most on TikTok. The familiarity of seeing promotional TikToks about new product launches made me really think about the current state of the Filipino makeup industry.

I remember watching new product launches from my favorite Western influencers on YouTube, sequentially and in droves, geared by their PR departments. That was nearly ten years ago. I have no doubt Filipino influencers have also been doing the same thing all this time (hello, I’m a former Project Vanity fanatic, too!), but not on the scale where it is now, not on the scale where it’s become so mainstream, where it’s not just an extension of Western culture, but it’s now as normal as ever to post reviews of local makeup products. On a larger scale, I’m now watching Filipino influencers talk about new product launches from local brands in the same way I used to watch Western influencers on YouTube.

Given the gap between us and the West and how long it took for the Filipino beauty community to be how it is now, I think it’s fair to say this community is in its infancy. And yes, I know local makeup brands and Filipino beauty influencers have existed long before I was even cognizant of wanting to buy makeup, but I’m sure you’ve noticed how different it is now. Full-fledged launch parties, an ecosystem of closely-linked Filipino beauty influencers, and an active feedback loop between brands and their consumers. It was never this big and apparent back then, and it’ll only keep getting bigger.

All this to say, I, as a consumer, have thought about extending these makeup companies the teeniest, tiniest bit of grace when it comes to how they operate their businesses. We’re playing catch-up with a decades-old industry, especially digitally, and it’s safe to assume these local makeup brands don’t have the budget, expertise, and legroom the same way NARS or Laura Mercier have. I’m sure we’ve all noticed multiple discrepancies from various brands about how they ideate, formulate, and market their products (looking at you, GRWM and Issy), and we should be critical and objective, but also it took decades for our favorite Western makeup brands to master how they operate in the beauty community. These local brands are less than a decade old, created by young, not-wholly-experienced entrepreneurs and business owners, and they’re churning out products that, for the most part, are created for Filipinos—which is the point of all this.

I understand finances play a big role in this, too. I absolutely understand a lot of Filipinos can’t afford to buy a so-so product and wait for the next and better iteration, and that’s something these business owners need to take into consideration. I’m all for cruelty-free cosmetics, but it’s rough when it seems like your active consumers are also your testers. It’s a catch-22 of wanting to listen to feedback vs. turning out these products that only get incrementally better (or worse) after every release. Should these businesses take their time with their product launches? Personally, my answer is an emphatic yes. Can these brands afford slow and steady launches? That, we don’t know. Either they can’t afford to do slow and steady, or their roadmaps aren’t as clear as we (or they) thought they were.

I haven’t bought anything from GRWM (except their foundation shade finder packets) or Issy. Recently, I’ve only bought makeup from Strokes (their brow products are decent!), and I’ve bought several products from Happy Skin over the years (and have been consistently underwhelmed by almost everything they’ve come out with). GRWM and Issy are by far the two that are going toe to toe to get the title of The Filipino Makeup Brand™. And yes, I know ☀️ exists, but I prefer not to include them in Filipino makeup discourse for Blengblong-related reasons.

Like I said, our beauty community is in its infancy relative to the West. Growing pains are inevitable. Miscommunication is inevitable. Not-so-great business decisions will be made. I think I have this perspective because I speak from experience as someone who has exclusively worked with startups and small businesses for years—these companies are ships with holes, and your job, every day, is to plug those holes and hope one day, you don’t have to plug holes anymore. The rest of the time, you’re hurling things out into the world for the public to buy so you can keep your sinking, hole-filled ship afloat.

And again, I’m not saying we should give these businesses a pass for being publicly messy—these companies exist for our satisfaction and convenience, and they should absolutely listen to our constructive criticism, but what I’ve written above can be something to think about. If you find these messy releases inexcusable, I totally get you, and you don’t have to make space for courteousness when your hard-earned money is on the line. I don’t want this to come off as propaganda to let these missteps slide. I completely agree that a brand like GRWM, for example, would benefit from a more experienced PR team regarding their wonky product launches. A better marketing plan. A better communication strategy. Better brand architecture. Things like those.

This is an incredibly scatterbrained post, but I thought it was worth discussing! Anyway. Because of their affordable prices (only compared to my history of being loyal to high-end makeup), these brands constantly tempt me to throttle the blue and orange apps. Maybe I’ll do a haul one day.",https://www.reddit.com/r/beautytalkph/comments/15sl4br/a_few_thoughts_on_the_filipino_makeup_scene/,234,54,Discussion,"ever bilena, blk, colourette, happy skin, issy, grwm, nars, laura mercier, opera","local, local, local, local, local, local, international, international, international","foundation, brow, makeup",tiktok,2023-08-16,Neutral
1fpjs42,"Etude Fixing Tint in Rose Lilac lippie review - swatch + gym + meal test I was initially disappointed when I received this because I was expecting a more saturated violet-leaning color like in the photos, but the actual color looks more brown-leaning and less saturated to me.

It sat ignored on my table for a while but I find myself reaching for it more often now, I think the color's growing on me! It does leave a decent stain after eating, too bad the stain color's not flattering for me.

It has a soft creamy texture that's a bit more liquidy compared to Peripera Ink Velvet, but less liquidy than Merzy Velvet Tint. Peripera and Merzy both feel like nothing on the lips, and this Etude Fixing Tint is *almost* like that, except it's a bit sticky even after drying.

Ranking my favorites
1. Peripera in milktea coral - very natural looking
2. Mac mineralize blush - good pigment and formulation 
3. Vice aura blush in soft mauve - good pigment
4. Sassy Colors in rosy flush - probably the most long lasting blush in this list
5. Rare Beauty in encourage - 50/50. Product leaks because of the packaging. Not long lasting 
6. Happy skin mallow pot in cinnamon swirl - pigment is nice, but feels silicone-y to skin
7. Vice blush duette in enchanted - powder is too pigmented thus it’s hard to control 
8. Colourette colorbounce - this is actually nice, i just picked a shade that doesn’t suit me
9. Canmake glow fleur - sheer pigment, but very glowy
10. Nars Orgasm - no pigment at all 🥲 nag reformulate sila. I feel like i wasted my money tbh

They are a bit similar in terms of shade and shimmer. Sobrang ganda!! Mas pigmented lang yung sa Vice and medyo mauvish. Mas sparkly rin ung shimmer ng Vice.

Mine’s the Skin1004 Madagascar Cleansing Oil. I wasn’t a believer of double cleansing way way back but now that I have tried it, my skin feels a lot cleaner than before. It’s non drying and doesn’t leave any oily residue after washing since it emulsifies. It’s great for easily removing make up & sunscreen.

Differin Gel Adapalene for acne!! This is the only thing that cleared my acne. I sandwich it with the Illiyoon Ceramide Ato Moisturizer to lessen drying out my skin. This combo worked wonders for me as someone who struggled acne for years.

1jeel63,"Lippies of an olive morena with dark lips Sharing some shades that works on me, an olive neutral medium morena with dark lips. Over the years, I’ve struggled with looking for the right shades that worked on me, most shades end up looking like orange ketchup or too pink on my lips. 

It took alot of trial and error and alot of money for me to identify that I have an olive undertone. At first I thought I was warm toned, lagi sinasabi sakin na I look yellow. Now narealize ko na I look more greenish pala haha. Out of 30 (!!) lip products I’ve bought, only 5 shades have worked for me. Most of these are really cheap as a broke student hehe.

Third pic is my bare lips. Pics are taken using my back cam. For reference I use the shade Talisay - Colourette First Base. 

Products used:

Careline Soft Suede Lipstick in Icon - I think this is phased out? Di na sya available online pero baka meron pa sa mga watsons. Soft matte and is lightweight on the lips. In person this leans more brown on me. Works better during the night time.

Ever Bilena Matte Lipstick in Mirrored Mocha - This is my favorite out of all my lippies. If only it lasts a bit longer >__< Advertised as matte pero parang satin naman sya? Doesn’t settle on my lip lines and di nya rin naeemphasize. MLBB shade.

Loreal Color Riche Intense in 520 Le Nude Defiant - got this on tiktok shop for B1T1 with another shade. This is a bit lighter so I sheer it out and use it as a base for other lippies. SUPER matte, not my most favorite in terms of formula. 

Etude Fixing Tint in Midnight Mauve - Also another super matte lippie, I also like use it as a base for glosses. Alone, it settles on inner lines and medyo light sya for me. If chronic dry lips ka I don’t recommend. Pero long lasting sya. Leaves a natural stain.

Peripera Ink Mood Glowy Tint in Mauve Chaos - favorite topper, can work alone pero di nya nammask yung dark lips ko so I rarely use it alone. I usually pair this with the Etude or Loreal since medyo nagooxidize sya. Leaves a beautiful stain.

1. Maybelline Vinyl Ink in Cheeky (got it on sale, P279 watsons podium w watsons card)
- packaging and applicator: drugstore feel, decent doe foot
- color: wearable light mauve on my lips, high coverage but subtle with my skintone (128)
- finish: glossy and tacky, vanilla scent, not drying
- longevity: lasts up to two meals or at least 6 hours, transfer proof
- would repurchase, I’ve recommended it to friends, worth trying, good for events! 

2. Barenbliss Peach Makes Perfect in Love Always (got it on sale P140 blue app) (my first time to try)
- packaging and applicator: doesn’t feel like drugstore, packaging sparks joy, above average applicator
- color: medium nude that oxidizes to red brown, quite sheer, shows up deep on my skintone
- finish: like vice co everlastint, I’m not a fan of gloss tints because they don’t look as plumping as pure lip gloss, they make my lips look wet instead of glossy, peach scent, clings to dry parts
- longevity: fades with drinks and meals, not transfer proof
- would not repurchase, too sheer for my two toned lips, not worth trying

3. Fresh Jelly Tinted Balm in reformulated Peach (P99 watsons)
- packaging and applicator: cap is transluscent so gets a little messy
- color: rose, highest lip balm coverage I’ve tried, could pass for lipstick, if you need emergency lipstick for some reason I highly recommend this
- finish: semi-matte, minty, not drying
- longevity: longest lasting lip balm I’ve tried because of intense pigment, almost lasts longer than other bullet lipsticks, not transfer proof
- would repurchase, would gift to friends, worth trying!

4. Happy Skin Lip Mallow in Honeymoon Glow (P349, first time to try)
- packaging and applicator: satisfying packaging, doe foot comfortable to use
- color: pink red on my skin tone, slightly sheer for a matte tint
- finish: super moisturizing on application, very lightweight like blk airy matte lip tint, clings to dry parts when I first tried
- longevity: surprisingly transferproof but doesn’t last through meals, best if you let it set well before drinking or eating

Contrary to popular belief by others, I take only around fifteen minutes to get ready before I leave for work, 5 minutes for makeup! I just like using my fingers and rarely any tools for this. Here’s what I use:

- Clinique moisture surge lip: I use this before I put on makeup, or after skincare, or before I sleep (sealed with Vaseline)
- Pixi brightening peach color corrector: definitely gets rid of my undereye darkness! I don’t think I’d ever do my makeup routine without it, plus, you use less concealer too!
- Maybelline age rewind: My second purchase after emptying one. Tip: remove the sponge! It will save you a lot more product, it’s more controlled, less messy, and more hygienic! 
- Detail color tonic in flamingo: For me this lasts pretty long, and fades well. Not cakey, and very natural looking. My skin tone btw is more fair-warm, but my mom with a medium skin tone also loves this! As both kami nagmamadali hahaha also compact!
- Peripera ink mood glowy tint in 03 rose in mind: I own three of these in different shades, and I’m almost out of this specific one! Lasts longer than the other tints, it’s super comfortable, and fades evenly. I think the contents are also konti lang since I ran out of it fast? But worth repurchasing too. 
- Maybelline sky high mascara: Probably would not repurchase, since it leaves my lashes clumpy (I have to comb it through pa). I’m going back to my Heroine one after finishing this! Pero pwede na.

1j3zqzc,"Makeup brushes I own and my thoughts on them just a disclaimer: none of these were given/sponsored, i bought them all with my own money and these are also just based on my experience.

dala: MY FAVEEE i love these brushes, naka ilang wash na ko sa kanila pero wala pa ring tusok feeling, they’re also not that dense and are actually really fluffy, i also really really love how big they are kasi it makes blending my makeup faster. for the price of around 1200 i think it’s actually a steal kasi u already get 6 brushes that have really great quality.

happy skin: the foundation brush is so far my most expensive brush, it costs around 400+ and for the quality it is not worth it. after a few washes may tusok feel na sila (except the cream cheek brush) and ang bilis masira ng handle (as u can see) i tried different glues just to put them back together kasi these are the first brushes that i owned. may crack na rin yung sa concealer brush and nagppeel off na yung paint nilang lahat. i used to love the cream cheek blush kasi it is what i mostly used to blend my liquid blushes pero i found a better one which is the dala’s. the concealer brush is too small for my liking and i prefer concealer brushes that are a little slanted.

absidy: i recently just got it (february) and sadly nakakailang wash pa lang ako may tusok feeling na. these are also dense so i mostly use them for cream products except for the settings brushes. i got these for around 1200 as well and may kasama nang 2 bags so imo it’s already pretty cheap. i have nothing else to say about these, they’re good but not that great.

sunnies: i got this before new year and so far wala syang tusok feeling kahit ilang beses ko na rin nalinisan. i use the big side for my cream blush and the other side for nose contour, it can also be used for foundation, concealer, and other cream products so it’s really good. i think i got it for around 300 (maybe 400?) and for that price u already have 2 brushes which u can use for different products so it is such a steal. it also comes with a little bag where u can store it.

**ChuChu Beauty Multiuse Heart Paint** - My new fave liquid blush! It's so pigmented, eto yung legit na one dot is enough. It also lasts long even if I have oily and pawisin skin. I got them in the shades ""Make a Mauve"" and ""Cheeky Coral"".

**Squad Cosmetics Celestial Eyes Eyeshadow Palette** - I haven't tried it yet

**Luxe Organix Panthenol Therapy 24h Lip Serum** - I love this! I know this is meant for lip prep but I use it as an actual lippie because it's so glossy, may onting tint, and it makes my lips so soft.

**Koji eyelash curler** - This is literally the perfect shape for my eyes. Hindi niya napipinch yung eyelids and lashes ko. Tayong-tayo yung lashes ko when I use this, and it holds the curl for the whole day if paired with a good mascara. I used to use a curler from Paulash before I has this, their shapes are similar, Koji is just more curved.

**Fashion21 Double Up Mascara** - My HG mascara! I will always buy this. It's so lengthening, it holds my curl for a decent amount of hours (not the whole day), it's tubing so it's easy to remove, and it's very affordable.

**Romand Juicy Lasting Tint** - Romand's JLT is my favorite lippie formula kaya I bought another shade, I got the shade ""#37 Mellow Pear"". This is so perfect as an everyday lippie. It's an mlbb shade once applied, it oxidizes naman to a natural looking pink after awhile.

1k8zpc8,"lip balm reviews 🌟 tried three of the most recommended lip balms in the local market, and thought of giving a quick review about them as a dry and flaking lipped girlie!

1. Lip Luster (Detail Cosmetics) — ⭐️⭐️⭐️
Gloss: 3/5 — not that long lasting
Moisture: 3/5 — does not really soften or heal my cracked lips
Scent/taste: 2/5 — I can’t understand the scent/taste; it doesn’t come off chocolatey to me, but more metallic
Consistency: 4/5 — thick but bearable

I bought this because I love Detail’s products and I read good reviews about it. Detail has the best nude colors — it’s true. But I wasn’t really satisfied with the performance of the product as a lip balm itself. It felt rather thick sitting on top of my lips and seeped under my cracks without moisturizing them.

2. Lip Glaze (Sunnies) — ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️.5
Gloss: 5/5 — long lasting shine 
Moisture: 5/5 — softens and moisturizes my lips for hours, and leaves it soft after
Scent/taste: 5/5 — not that strong; subtle
Consistency: 3/5 — very thick

This is the first one I purchased — and my only Sunnies product lol. And honestly, I would’ve stuck with it had it not been so thick that it droops down my lips. For context, my lips are thick and are quite pouty, so whenever I apply lip products that are too thick or runny, it droops down my lips. The lip glaze is my favorite as a lip treatment — I use it before bed and during lip prep, but it’s not something I’d wear outside because I’d be constantly checking if it’s drooping down my lips. Otherwise, I really love it.

3. GlossBalm (Muse) — ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
Gloss: 5/5
Moisture: 5/5
Scent/taste: 5/5 — as preference; I like sweet scented products
Consistency: 5/5 — glides like butter and not too heavy

The latest one I purchased. I’m not willing to hate pan the Detail one so I finally gave in after months of contemplation — and I don’t regret it. Finally, a treatment and topper that I could wear outside all in one! ☝️ The gloss is lovely and it’s really moisturizing. Notably, among the three, this has the most product amount. 

Of the three, I would repurchase Muse and Sunnies.",https://i.redd.it/ilzc593hfcxe1.jpeg,223,54,Review,sunnies,local,"lip balm, lip balms",,2025-04-27,Neutral

It’s a mix of live and digital experiences, often featuring interactive product booths, expert-led panels, and workshops. Attendees can try out products, meet brand founders, and get personalized beauty advice. It’s also a way for Sephora to showcase new products and trends, often offering exclusive shopping opportunities or early access to popular items.”

I’m a Pinay working in UAE and I just attended the first Sephoria event in the Middle East. I came to know about this event when I chanced upon it here on Reddit so when Sephora UAE announced they would hold the event here *syempre* as a makeup enthusiast I had to attend it. *Yun nga lang*, I hesitated to buy the gold ticket because of my work schedule and by the time I fixed it only the general admission was available. 

Anyway, *hinatak ko si hubby* since no girlfriends of mine are interested in attending which makes it a double-edged sword. The Pro is I collect freebies double the amount that I should have but the con is I don't get to share the excitement of trying out and discovering new make-ups. 

So, these are all the freebies that I’ve got and won *kasi* some brands hold games for you to win prizes. I wasn't able to visit all the brands cos of the long queue and *nakakapagod na* since we were there at 2 pm. We were at the event for 4 hours but they're open until 10 pm since I live in Abu Dhabi (for those who don't know Dubai is a 2 hr drive to Abu Dhabi) we left around 6. 

I paid 500 aes for each ticket and for the freebies I’ve got including free meals and drinks, I’d say I got back my money’s worth.

1fnhfq4,"Revlon Ultra HD Matte Lip Mousse in Crimson Sky - gym + meal test + get ready with me Revlon Ultra HD Matte Lip Mousse in Crimson Sky - gym & meal test + get ready with me

Hada Labo Hydrating Lotion - I like this a lot, it might replace CosRX Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence as a staple in my routine. I think I prefer Hada Labo's more watery texture.

Biore Perfect Bright Face Milk Sunscreen - I've used this for years and I've tried several other sunscreens but nothing's beat this yet! Others I've tried include:
La Roche Posay Anthelios Invisible Fluid (a bit greasy but it absorbs after a while; I use this specifically if I want a glowy finish or for swimming since it's very waterproof)
Skin1004 Hyalu-Cica Water-Fit Sun Serum (a bit greasy + it stings my face; ok for body)
Hello Glow Ultralight Matte Sunscreen (it's ok but a bit silicone-y, doesn't blend well w/ my makeup)
Anessa Sunscreen Gold Spray, Belo Sunexpert Transparent Mist Spray (both too greasy, ok for body)
Kiss Me Sunkiller Perfect Water Essence (too sticky, stays sticky even after drying)

Biore face milk is, so far, the only non-greasy non-sticky non-pilling sunscreen on me. It also blends super well with my makeup and also has a nice blurring/smoothing effect.

Before putting on any lippie I make sure my lips are hydrated. I rub them with water for a few minutes or however long it takes (it takes longer if I need to exfoliate them too) for them to be soft and smooth.

Revlon Ultra HD Matte Lip Mousse in Crimson Sky has been my top fave lippie the past few years. I've gone weeks without using any other lippie! When I travel I can bring just this one. I love its lightweight feel and its rich cool-toned deep ruby/berry/wine shade. This lasts through my workouts and leaves a slight stain after meals. (The one I have in the video is covered with tape because the label got damaged from perfume that leaked in my bag)

I always use my fingertip to apply lippies, it helps with the blurring effect. The leftover on my fingertip becomes my blush.

I've just bought the Happy Skin Matte Setting Spray. So far it seems ok, I like the ultra-fine mist. Was previously using Luxe Organix's Beauty Mist Setting Spray, worked alright but it didn't have a fine mist.",https://v.redd.it/x0iv1tq1gjqd1,222,26,Review,"belo, happy skin, revlon, kiss me","local, local, international, international","blush, setting spray, makeup",,2024-09-23,Neutral
1lq2xhp,"My Swatches of Clinique Black Honey Dupes Top to bottom: Clinique Black Honey, 
GRWM Lip Booze Tequila, Nivea Rich Care and Color lip balm in Bordeaux, 
Nivea Rich Care and Color lip balm in cherry brown, and Burt’s bees Red Dahlia 

So I love Black Honey, and I set out to find a decent dupe. My guidelines were:

1. Must be a tinted lip balm not a lipstick 
2. Can’t be more than 500 pesos 

I don’t think I found the perfect dupe, but color wise I’d say on camera, Nivea Bordeaux is closest (but be aware that the product has fine shimmer), and in-person the closest was GRWM lip booze in Tequila. Burt’s Bees Red Dahlia was also pretty good but very lightly pigmented. I really had to press down and swipe over ten times to get the color in the photograph.

1kqb81q,"Ang hirap naman kalaban ng pawis I just recently rekindled my spark with makeup and skincare and have been trying out new products. But I’m slowly getting discouraged again kasi ang pawisin ng face ko esp dahil summer ngayon. I’m an office girl and umaga pa lang stressed na ako pag dating sa office kasi haggard na agad.

I have normal to dry skin but yung scalp and face ko mismo yung pawisin. It’s so bad to the point na skincare pa lang, ayaw na ma-absorb because humalo na sa pawis. I get ready in the morning in front of the fan, but I’m losing motivation to make an effort to be presentable when I know I’m just gonna sweat it away.

Any tips or personal experience you can share to make this more bearable? Not looking for medical related advice, just practical advice on skincare/makeup application, commute hacks etc.

Edit: I appreciate eveyone’s suggestions! Here’s majority of them:
- Mag ayos na lang sa office (will adjust my morning routine to try this)
- Cooling powder or sprays, and sweatproof primer
- Light/gel sunscreen and minimal makeup products yet reliable

medyo partial ako sa dazzle me. medyo same-ish shades pero hindi lahat light colors. di tulad ng happy skin at blk 😒 at least may bagong release yung colourette na skin tint na maganda actually. i'm planning on buying it after i ran out of my current issy and co one

iypeac,"Looking for a Dermatologist? Try PGH OPD Dermatology 💯 Let me share my experience with the dermatologists from PGH Dermatology OPD. 

I was diagnosed with Acne Vulgaris last 2017. I must admit it was because of me applying several creams on my face and even joining the bandwagon for that 10-step K Skincare. It was really hopeless as I have countless zits and dark pimple marks all over my face. It lowered my self-esteem, ocean deep. Not until I was encouraged to go to PGH OPD by a colleague and there, since then my life changed. 

My dermatologist during that time was so accommodating huhu I love her promise but she graduated already. She was educating me about the products I use and what should I discontinue. She carefully reviewed the products’ ingredients and told me why. Ever since my face and life changed. She even recommended where can I buy cheap yet effective creams for my acne ointment. I now currently have clear skin with occassional pimples and marks (not glass skin because we are humans and not glass haha please do not aim for this type of skin - one of the wonders of makeup and marketing illusion)

QUESTION: “I cannot go to PGH for the derma checkup or consult because of this pandemic, so paano?” —— They still cater via online and the good thing about it is it is free! Just visit pghopd.up.edu.ph to create an  appointment (make sure to create your patient account). Please be patient while awaiting for an appointment schedule! Worth the wait. 

If only I can show you my before and after face. I am super obedient to their plans and prescribed ointments. A lot of patience is needed when you want to treat your acne - nothing works overnight. Do not believe products or people saying they can cure it for a month or a week. It took me a year and a few months to achieve my current skin. They will try to work on ointments and medications fit for your budget but if you have to spend a few peso for some meds - go for it. Anyway, it is your skin after all 💕 Have an open mind when you see a dermatologist. 

And take note it is still best to see a dermatologist if you have a pressing skin concern or issue. I myself admit to watch a lot of vlogs and what these beauty gurus say but truth be told, they also see dermatologists. So my advice, stick with a PDS certified dermatologists for your skincare needs. You need not to be rich for you to afford a dermatology consult, that is why I am sharing with you PGH OPD Dermatology 💕",https://www.reddit.com/r/beautytalkph/comments/iypeac/looking_for_a_dermatologist_try_pgh_opd/,217,91,Review,vice,local,makeup,,2020-09-24,Neutral
1dn7hzp,"Colourette's First Base As a girly na hindi talaga naglalagay ng foundation, concealer, or skin tint prior to trying this product eh I've been using this skin tint  in the shade Nacpan for more than a month (almost everyday, ang pahinga lang yata ay pag day off ko at walang gala) and it is so soooo good. I have a combination skin (oily ang T-zone while dry naman ang bandang cheeks), acne prone, and may redness din sa ibang parts ng face. It feels so lightweight and shade match is on point (kay Miss Nina ako nagrerely ng shade). Commute girly din ako at pawisin ang mukha pero hindi sya humuhulas sa akin. What I do is naglalagay ako ng thin layer lang and ibbuild ko nalang ang coverage kung kelangan talaga (since buildable naman coverage nya). It really is a skin tint kasi it makes my skin looks so much better (My skin but better ang peg). Ang nakikita ko lang na downside nya ay pag naka lapat sya sa sunscreen (I use Luxe Organix sunstick, yung matte), namumuo kasi yung skin tint on top of it habang tumatagal. But when I use it alone, hindi sya yung nagkakaroon ng pamumuo and okay pa rin yung skin tint kahit lagpas 10hrs ko na suot. I tried wearing it din before working out, hindi talaga humuhulas. Mas nagiging fresh ako tignan habang tumatagal kahit na sobrang pawisin talaga ng mukha ko. 

For its longevity, I'll give this a 9/10. Pakak pa rin talaga yung coverage kahit pawisan, magcommute, maging oily all throughout the day. It's just that, namumuo yung product when nilalagay sya on top of the luxe organix sunstick (yung yellow). Sa akin, I don't mind kasi namumuo sya pag matagal na nasa face yung product which in my case usually pag pauwi na rin ako from work. Btw, I set it with GRWM Velvet Setting Powder in the shade Nutmeg. I use a powder brush and konti lang nilalagay ko na powder pang set dito. 

For its coverage, it's a 10/10. For a skin tint, maganda coverage nya. Hindi na ko nag cconcealer kahit na I have lines under my eyes (katulad kay Itachi 😂) Natatakpan naman ang redness kahit papaano. Hindi sya full coverage pero buildable ito. For what I need, it's just enough to give me a ""my skin but better"" na peg talaga. Pang everyday talaga sya. 

For its scent, hindi matapang amoy nya. Sakto lang, usual amoy ng base product pero mild lang. Hindi masakit sa ilong. 

For its price, I believe mahal pa sya for students pero they have discounts naman sa T1ktok app and 🍊 app. 599 is very sulit na for me given na maganda naman performance ng product. I got mine at a regular price (Php 599) pero may free sponge. Sponge is okay din talaga IMO. I use it dry, btw. 

So if you're seeing this and still is contemplating on buying it, go mo na yan hahahah! Take it from me na init na init pag naglalagay ng base products kaya before ko malaman na may ganitong skin tint eh talagang GRWM Velvet Setting Powder lang nilalagay ko sa face ko dati. Ngayon, kahit mag gym ako di sya (First Base skin tint) mawawala sa mukha ko 😂. 

Miss Nina, if you're seeing this parang dasarb ko ng PR kasi 70% ng make up ko eh from your brand AHAHAHAHAHAH. But srsly, ang ganda nito at mukhang pinag isipan talaga yung formula given we live in a tropical country. Thank you so much for creating this, di na ko mabubuhay without it HAHDHWHSHA EME 😂

1d5647u,"Makeup haul I got obsessed with makeup again and decided to haul and indulge myself just because. These are buys from February till yesterday and some are gifted. I’m 1 month post partum and currently in maternity leave so I'm just at home most of time kaya kahit grocery or park I wear makeup kasi sayang 😅

Complexion: 
Lancome Teint Idole Ultra Wear - i just bought this yesterday so i haven’t got the chance to use it  yet. Chanel Les Beiges Water Fresh Tint - I love this for my no makeup makeup day. 
Dior forever - i love this on my combination oily face and it looks natural under sunlight BUT it oxidizes on me so i mix it with my ELDW sheer long wear that is 2 shades lighter on me.
Huda beauty loose and pressed powders - I like the loose powder but i hate the pressed ones. The latter looks cakey especially for touch ups. I bought pound cake for overall and peach pie for under eye. 
Chanel Les Beiges Healthy Glow Sheer powder 
Natasha Denona concealer - i bought this because i saw one MU raving it but my dry under eye is hating it. 
Dior forever concealer - i use this for my under eyes and i’m loving it. I find it medium coverage atleast
Huda beauty corrector - while i do like it, I HATE the packaging. No matter how i store it, it leaks everywhere. 
Charlotte Tillbury Flawless Filter and Elf Halo Glow liquid filter - Eh, i could live without it and i don’t even noticed any difference when using it. I usually buy a drugstore brand for work (i’m a nurse) and luxury brand when i’m going out. 
Elf power grip primer - It helps keep my oiliness at bay without touch-ups when at work
Fenty Beauty primer - I used this for my pores and when I go out since I wear heavy duty foundation anyway. 

Cheeks:
Fenty beauty matte contour stick 
Dior forever glow maximer - I love the subtle glow. Glowy but not oily. 
Hourglass snake palette - honestly I don’t reach for this often but when I do, I used bronzer and radiant light finishing powder only
Nars afterglow liquid blush - I love this because it’s easy to blend and not in your face. 
Nars powder blush - need I say more? 
Milani baked blush - bought this for bars orgasm dupe 
Chanel Les beiges bronzing cream - LOVE. Easy to blend and not orangey on my skin. 
Dior glow face palette 
Elf liquid blush - I don't hate it but I'll give away the other colors just because it's too much even if I used just a pea-size amount. 
Kevyn Aucoin contour powder -my trusted cool tone contour powder. 

Eyes:
Dior eye palette - Color payoff is alright. 
Natasha Denona I need a nude palette - I didn’t realized it’s a cool tone palette until after I bought it. 

I didn’t include lip products kasi I'm too lazy to swatch it. 

So there ya go. I need to delete my sephora app because I'm still eyeing some make ups that I know I don't need but I want.

Sunnies in the shade cherub - 4/5 
This blush is very controversial but went for it because I really liked the packaging (huhu i know can’t resist) tbh did not really expect it pero i’ve been using the miniso blush then switched to this. Longevity wise, di siya ganun ka long lasting sa akin if i use it alone. Still prefer using it with a blush topper. 


Colourette colourbounce in the shade cheeky -5/5 

I LOVE THIS AS MY BLUSH TOPPER. I got this as a gift lang. Nagulat ako kasi whenever I use my camera freshly after makeup, hindi ganun katapang face ko (compared if marinated na makeup ko). I therefore conclude na siguro may blush blindness talaga ako all these time and this is the only blush that gives me that glow without looking so harsh. 

Also i’m a glitter blush girly eversince so I really really liked this. By using this, i actually figured out na hindi bagay sakin yung bright pink blushes (eh halos ganon mga nasa collection ko huhu)

Packaging: ganda ng packaging! You can feel na premium siya and there is a weight to it pati yung lock parang hindi siya agad masisira.

After 5 hours no primer sa eyeshadow, infairness! No creasing and I have oily lids. 

Scent: parang wala nmn scent na detectable while using it.

I started wearing it this month lang and it was life changing! I have dark and kinda thick but sparse and uneven brows, as in nag-iiba ang shape nila depende sa alignment ng stars, and I used to just fill them in with brow powder. Ngayon, konting brow gel lang and I am good to go! My simplest everyday face is just sunscreen, skin tint, and brow gel.

On the other hand, I used to love doing intricate eye looks. As in multiple eyeshadow shades, full wing, tightline - you know the 2017 eye look. Now I dont even use eyeshadow that much anymore. Isang swipe lang ng any shimmer shade sa lids, brown subtle liner, and a layer of mascara.

1g7p42e,"Review on the BLK invisible gel powder Was very curious about gel powders and saw that BLK had one so I bought it. I have oily skin and pores na medyo visible. It retails for P599 pesos but got it for P499 because there was a sale.

The gel powder was advertised as mattifyng, pore blurring that can be used as a primer and a touch up powder. 

Texture wise, if you touch it, very powdery siliconey yong feel. Parang yong powder sa goma ganon. It has a very natural finish. It didn’t work as a primer for me. Yes, it removed the shine from my skin prep but it didn’t really have a pore blurring effect. As in nagstop na lang siya sa pag remove ng shine pero wala siyang natulong sa makeup look and sa wear test. I think this would better work as a touch up powder lang.

For the price, I will not repurchase and just continue using it hanggang maubos. Sobrang invisible kasi hindi mo makita kung may na pick up ka bang product. Sobrang nipis din ng puff so it’s flimsy and you have an uneven application, minsan may buo buo pa sa mukha when I touch up dahil sa nipis ng puff and sa pagiging clear ng product.

Overall, I will pass on gel powders and would stick to pressed powders na lang for touch ups.",https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1g7p42e,204,58,Review,blk,local,"primer, powder, powders, makeup",,2024-10-20,Negative
17qpydk,"cuco nail polish bought this one recently, because i usually opt for easy removing of nail polishes and gel nails are so hard to remove and i don’t have the patience for it. 


so, i bought 3 shades which is eggshell, chiffon and all clear. as soon as i received the nail polishes i went and prepped my nails, make sure they’re clean and oil free and boy, i am impressed with this brand i have it on for 4 days already and it hasn’t chipped at all! i didn’t bother to be careful with them so i can really test it, and do my usual stuff like cleaning my nails using a brush when showering, or using a loofah to scrub my body and hands and wow no damage at all! and we all know that when we do the dishes with just a regular polish after washing the dishes the nails are chipped na. so i kinda love this kasi it stay put. 


the only thing i’m having a hard time while using cuco polishes is because the formula is thick and kinda hard to manipulate but it self levels naman so all good pero medyo oc kasi ako kaya ganun. nonetheless, okay siya for me will buy more nuetral colors! 


colors:


chiffon - milky creamy white color and not stark white! i love the translucency of it.


eggshell - the popular nail color trend right now which is vanilla nail, it’s perfect for it. it’s creamy with hint of yellow undertone! 


all clear - nothing special tbh. i’d go for the sassy colors magic gel top coat since it’s glossier than this one. 

will also update by the end of the week on how is it holding up on my nails - yes, that’s my natural nail length - 🥰",https://www.reddit.com/gallery/17qpydk,206,51,Review,cuco,local,brush,,2023-11-08,Positive
1dceei7,"Detail vs Rom&nd eyeshadow palettes Detail Cosmetics released their new eyeshadow palettes (got mine in Watsons SM North). I think this is their new version of their eyshadow palettes kasi meron na sila dati. I got the shade Soleil pero dapat kukunin ko Obelisk pero siguro sa susunod na lang or pag nasa online na. The price is 749 and I think it's not bad since mahal naman talaga magformulate ng shadows in diff finishes. It got mattes, shimmers, and yung glittery na may chunks. 

They're buttery and smooth upon swatch but I have yet to try it since wala pa akong pupuntahan. Soleil is this warm-toned palette and very prominent ang peach tones nito perfect for that bronzed look or yung ""espresso"" makeup ala Sabrina Carpenter. 

Now, a lot of you would think na dupe to ng Romand palette in Pampas Garden and I think di naman. First, hindi ganun ka-warm ang sa Romand. For Aegyosal ang sa Romand while sa Detail is really perfect for that glam look. Sa price point naman, di naman sila nagkakalayo kasi around 100 pesos lang difference nila tas probably bababa pa sa Detail pag online na at may sale. May mabubudol na naman satin ang Detail hahaha.

1gdh4p0,"another really cheap haul + swatches + review 
Hi! A few weeks earlier, nagpost rin ako dito ng really cheap haul bc as a student, vv limited lang budget ko (real). Kasi nasobrahan ako sa stress-buying lately and ended up buying makeup when there’s a sale 😅 halos Squad to kasi available sa Robinsons nearest to me and nag-50% birthday sale sila.

Again, for reference, I am a dry-skinned girlie with olive light-medium skin.

1. **Squad Mellow Matte** - originally ₱249, bought it for ₱100
    - My favorite buy! I’m a water tint kinda girlie pero really going for the clean girl look kaya I thought - why not try this? ₱100 lang naman, packaging is really pretty pa. I chose between Rosie and Clean Girl, chose Rosie kasi it was a very bit more pinkish. No regrets. Di lang super long lasting especially bc I tend to lick my lips a lot. Effortless application, I can put it on without looking at a mirror. Bought at Robinsons Dept Store.

2. **Squad makeup remover wipes** - originally ₱99, bought for ₱50 at RDS
    - Ubos na micellar ko and saw this - now I wonder why I bothered with micellar + cotton pads pa when these exist. Successfully removes all my makeup (but ofc nag wawash pa din ako ng face). I used this to remove the swatches on the pictures attached din and completely removed sila. No scent siya for me.

3. **Squad Happy Pot in Muse** - originally ₱99, bought for ₱50 at RDS
    - my next favorite buy after mellow matte!! My classmate also tried this and gandang ganda siya, she messaged me after class pa to ask what it was and what shade. It was less pink when applied to my cheeks, vv natural looking and it just melts into skin, like ang ganda ng lapat. I use my fingers to blend it. Longevity is not as long as my HS color stick though - 5 hours at best siguro pero I see no issue reapplying naman. It doesn’t mess up over whatever makeup I still has on at that hour. No need to set as well, it’s not sticky at all. Parang skin lang talaga. 

4. **Colourette First Base Mini** - originally ₱199, bought during Shopee release at ₱150 (vouchers and live price)
    - literally the best color match as an olive light-med girly. As in kapag nasa face ko na it just looks like my skin but better. Maliit talaga siya and feel ko madaling maubos, tapos since airy tube yung packaging, di ko macontrol how much comes out. I’m a dry-skinned girl and I still prefer my Detail kahit better ang color match nito since detail just makes me glow haha. Aside from the shade match, I find theres nothing very special about it - unless you’re oily siguro.

5. **Squad Lock It In Setting Spray in 50mL** - originally ₱299, bought at ₱150 during Shopee Squad Birthday Sale
    - Really disappointed in this sadly :((( Akala ko it just doesn’t work with my regime pero tinry ko nga dyan sa swatches in the photos and nawala talaga halos. My happy skin blush usually lasts me 12+ hours on duty sa random setting spray ko at home but this one just doesn’t last over 4 hours. By lunchtime wala na blush ko. It also cakes up my powder kaya nagppowder nalang ako (Issy or Dr Sensitive) after it dries. Very very strong din ang vanilla scent, nung nagspray ako sa room naamoy hanggang kabilang table - scent-sensitive people might not be too happy about this. I will not repurchase, I’ll stick to my vv random hydrating glow-getter spray na nabibili sa Rob Supermarket. That one makes my makeup last and really GLOWS.

6. **Squad Strobe Wand Illuminating Blush** - originally ₱299, bought for ₱150 at Shopee Squad Birthday Sale
    - Not very special as well. I was most excited for this but I don’t reach for it at all after buying. It’s not “glowy”, glitters are fine pero nawawala din upon application eh. Tapos when I spread it sa cheeks parang patchy? ba ang term? like yung part na nahahawakan ng finger ko ay nagsspread and kumpol yung color dun ganern. Dapat careful ka when applying. Maganda though na it’s buildable and not sheer! I personally don’t think it’s as illuminating as advertised. Maganda din yung packaging since may twist lock siya, which keeps the product safely stored even pag squeezed accidentally. I’m not most confident lang na the sponge applicator will remain scentless after a while…

7. **Squad dip liner in brown** - ₱149, bought at regular price in RDS
    - Dapat higher to but I forgot about it hahah!! I love it so much kasi manipis ang brush tip and it just SETS. Never smudged whatsoever. Yung pagka-brown din is just natural. I use it over my lash line and a very subtle wing kasi di talaga ako marunong mag liner and I have uneven lids. I inserted a little pic sa face swatches for reference. It’s a subtle way to REALLY improve your eyes.

8. **Rain Hey Curl! Mascara** - ₱85, bought at regular price in RDS
    - Literally does nothing. Just don’t. Matigas na din nung bagong bili, had to melt it in hot water pero wala din. I struggled to even swatch it.

1h7bgsd,"I have the worst service experience to Nailashes Beauty Lounge 8883 Makati Branch I was told that there's available schedule around 5-6:30pm which I went into. 

There are three of them and the lash tech was the absurdest, 

1. Unprofessionalism - speaking to the client? Its okay to be casual but their rude tones and making jokes upon entering the shop is not acceptable. They even making negative and hateful remarks to customers that was walking in the shop after they went out. This lash tech even said ""Kasalanan ba namin Mam na bukas ang Christmas Party ninyo?"", ""ate chona"" which means also rude or someone giving attitude remarks when the customer had politely asked

2. BLAMING THE CUSTOMER TO HER POOR LASH TECH QUALITY SERVICE - While the lash tech was doing my lashes, I was really tired that time since I came from work and almost went to sleep but have woken up since I heard her blubbering to my EARS from her colleagues saying ""Si Mam naman kasi eh""(referring to my already removed mascara)""Kasalanan ni Mam yan"", She also said in a gay lingo (her two colleagues our gay) poorly assuming I wouldn't understood it. ""Di pa tapos, paylalu na"" obviously, she's blaming it will fail after just a day.

3. VERY LOUD/NOISY AMBIANCE - Yes, they were literally telling stories while doing my nails and lashes and all you could hear was their loud voices. I don't actually have problems with that I've been to many salons. This one was different, they were being negative and all they say are purely non sense and what's worse? 

4. THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT THEIR SEX LIFE - in a manner where they tell stories about their s*x positions, men they making out and how they do it ???! Does a customer have to hear all that? It's like they don't effing care what a customer thinks or feel in a uncomfortable situation 

5. RUSHING & BECOMING IRRITABLE BECAUSE THE LASH TECH HAD A DATE - This same lash tech, she never made me feel at ease when all I want is just to get it done. She was mentioning that she had someone waiting for her and that she would check in with him. ""Boyet"" -This is not her boyfriend and I already even know the name of the guy since she repeatedly keep mentioning him and their non sense stories.

6. DON'T GET YOUR NAILS DONE HERE - My nails was done before from other shops, the nail tech was NOT FRIENDLY & makes you feel like you're not welcome to their shop. I will let that slide, the problem is that she massacred my nails and keeps digging that my skin already bled. I even told her to be gentle with it because she can ""see"" it naman and she damaged my skin on that middle and ring area. My skin was pretty delicate, I have very white skin so it can be easily shown.

Tbh, this can be ignored I don't usually make big deal of things but there are LOTS OF RED FLAGS. If you want to close the shop you can just told the CUSTOMERS, they'll moved on to other shops that will welcome them. Not be grumpy when you want to logged out from work. Im sure its NOT THE BUSINESS but the people that are in it. Hope these kind of people can be mindful because not all customers are just throwing their hard earned money.

Fyi ~ The lashes all fall off after two days. They have lots of followers online so the expectations went downhill to core of the ground.

1e5prfi,"An unimpressive empties post since takot ako gumastos 😂💀 I'm actually surprised nakaubos pala ako ng 4 lippies in the last few years but tbh the colourette lip gloss just sits on top of your lips so this actually only lasted me 3 months of consistent use (love the shades tho!) The blythe ones also needed constant reapplication since I drink a lot of warm coffee and tea. For the maybelline one, I think that one is just old siguro 5 years old na yan pwede na ipasok sa pre-school 😂

This is among the first formulations of the grwm milky tint (if not the actual first formula) and tbh mabilis siya mahulas sa skin but it taints pretty well on my lips. I use it under my other lippies since if nahulas na yung iba I still have color. I wouldn't repurchase though. I don't think it's that special of a product for me to repurchase, and I don't like the direction that the brand has been taking in the last years.

The Detail Fresh Filter i got was actually a shade too light, so I had to correct it a little with a concealer that I got too dark for me. Honestly, I learned it with this foundation that I should stick to skin tints. It's okay but WNR since I didn't like how it looked on my skin especially sa nose area.

For my skincare products, I'd repurchase all of these except the Tocobo sun stick. I'm fine with it but I think mas prefer ko pa rin magreapply with a liquid sunscreen. For BOJ, I'd repurchase it if it was on sale lang since I think may mga okay rin naman na sunscreen na cheaper. Currently, I'm using Eucerin Oil Control Dry Touch Sun Gel Cream and i dont see anyone else talking about this so idk if me lang but sobrang similar niya sa BOJ sunscreen in terms of feel and even color nung cream + i got the Eucerin one in a B1T1 sale in an Italian pharmacy so it was cheaper.

1ewpthv,"Lip Gloss Honest Review ok so the girlypop bought the hydragloss as my first ever lip gloss because nabudol sa tiktok and after naka ipon and nagb1t1 ang maybelline thank god nakakuha hehehe. So here’s my brutally honest review:

Pangit naman if every 30 mins ka mag apply kasi drying sya sa lips even though nag lip prep na. Not worth the hype and the price. So pls wag kayo basta basta magpapabudol sa tiktok hype😭

I tried using it when we went to church and hanggang natapos ang mass na almost 1hr & 30 mins may gloss parin na natira sa lips ko. Di din sya drying sa lips and di sya heavy pag i apply sa lips.

I would say these are all great for normal-oily girlies. 

- Estee Lauder Double Wear Sheer - easier for me to use since the full coverage one need magdahan dahan
- Hourglass and Nars concealers - hands down, best I’ve tried will repurchase basta paubos na it’s so easy to use, does not crease or move pag na-set na. Kakayanin ka ilaban nito sa initan
- CT and LM powder - ay ito pang SG Humid Levels, fresh from morning to night. If di ka mahilig mag retouch go for LM, if bet mo filtered buong face mo CT na lalo for photos 
- Dior blush - the longer it sits on your face the prettier it gets! 
- Givenchy Lippie - This was gifted but I didn’t realize how much I’d actually love it, one swipe goodness but it’s not really a staple level just really nice to have Sunnies’ Fluffmatte can compete with this na.

1h0ysry,"Issy Setting Spray Review I’ve tried a bunch of setting sprays: Charlotte Tilbury, ELF, GRWM (Matte), Sunnies Skin So Good... you name it! Even the ones from Dazzle Me! While all of these are good, my makeup tends to separate or get cakey by the end of the day. Just to clarify, I haven’t changed ANY of my base products or blushes—just swapped out my mascara or lashes, and of course, my lippies

Here’s a quick breakdown of my almost-empties:

**CT**: The most expensive of the bunch. It gives a slight dewy finish, so I usually add another layer of powder once it dries. I had high hopes for this because of the hype (and, well, it’s Charlotte Tilbury). But if you have oily-combo skin like me, it might be best for indoor use or when traveling abroad.

**ELF**: Super mattifying! I used to love this, but whenever I sweat or if it’s humid, my makeup tends to cake, especially during night outs, and I end up looking ""hulas.""

**GRWM (Matte)**: Mid formula, at least FOR ME. Not a fan of the spray—it’s clogged on me a couple of times and spits out product, which makes it harder to apply compared to other sprays I’ve used. I still have half a bottle left because I just haven’t been able to use it much.

**Sunnies Face Skin So Good**: LOVE this one. I use it for quick errands or when I’m going for that no-makeup makeup look. I also use it whenever I know I’ll be indoors the whole day, like in an air-conditioned space. The finish is natural—not matte, not dewy. If you have super oily skin and prefer a matte look, though, this might not be for you. I have combination skin and don’t mind blotting every now and then. I’ve worn this out, rode an Angkas, and stayed under the sun for a while—my makeup separated a bit, but nowhere near as bad as with the CT spray.

**My most recent, and most definitely my new fave**: **Issy’s Setting Spray (Matte)**.

Honestly, I didn’t expect much from this one—it was a blind buy. I’ve tried Issy products before (some I loved, some I didn’t), but THIS? It totally surprised me. It's on the pricier side if you're looking for a budget-friendly setting spray, but hear me out. While it’s marketed as “matte,” I’d say it gives more of a ""demi-matte"" finish—not too dewy, not too flat matte. I’ve used it indoors, during my commute, outdoors, and in places with no aircon. I sweat, I get oily—and my makeup still didn’t cake or separate! It really melts the powders in and keeps my makeup looking fresh, even at the end of the day.

I have super sensitive skin, and it has a light fragrance, but it’s not overpowering and fades quickly. I think I might start hoarding this one!

1dmobzf,"Sunnies Face Blush On Mini Review Got the new Sunnies Face Blush On in Cherub, and wanted to share some of my initial thoughts. 

Packaging: Component is really cute, I love the whole baby bottle concept. Sunnies really never misses in terms of packaging design, it’s adorable. Also has a chubby doe foot applicator, which I quite like for liquid blushes. 

Shade range: I swatched all of the shades in store, and I quite like the shade range? It seems varying enough, I went with Cherub first though because I feel like it will be the shade that will be quick to sell out. 

Formula: It’s scentless, from what I can tell. When I dot it on my hand, the pigment is very apparent which is really nice given that this is one of the lighter, pinker shades. It feels quite light, not thick or whatever. Feels also very nourishing, though I have yet to test the claims of the whole skincare ingredients thing. I’m a fan of the Happy Skin Serum Blush, so let’s see how that performs. When it’s blended on my hand (used the Marj Happy Skin Cream Cheek Brush), it turns a bit sheer- which I personally like for my blushes.

1fa8szr,"completed my daily makeup routine products 🎀  After getting rid of all my expired makeup during the pandemic, I decided to start fresh and curated a makeup routine by being intentional with purchasing each product. It feels great!


I now have a rule not to buy/open anything new until I finish a product. I haven’t hit pan on most but with daily use I’m sure to hit pan on all of these soon.


Product list:


Face:


I’m Meme Color Pattern Palette in 003 Sand Pattern - I only mostly use shade 7 (Malibu) as an easy bronzer / contour. love that the cover has combinations of the shades you could use so it’s very beginner friendly 


Ellana Stay Matte Poreless Oil Control Powder - heard good things about this. No white cast and I even carry it with me for touch ups during the day


nuse Liquid Care Cheek in 01 Dazzle Ginger - so natural and leaves a soft glow, I think I’m halfway through the bottle 


Canmake cream cheek in 05 Sweet Apricot- love placing this just under my eyes , such a pretty shade. It has a melting gel texture and has some subtle shimmer/glitter


Cezanne Pearl Glow Highlighter in 01 - quality is amazing and it’s affordable too


Bench Beauty Brow Fixer - affordable and does the job 


*The Saem Perfect Pore Primer & blk Skin Tint in Sand - I only sometimes use, as I prefer no base/foundation 


Eyes:


Canmake Creamy Touch Liner in 03 Dark Brown - my HG! can create the easiest baby wing 


Heroine Make Long Up Mascara - y’all know she needs no introduction!! 


Peripera All Take Mood Palette in #18 Have a Lucky Beige - the easiest neutral palette for everyday looks, has mattes and shimmers 


Lips:


I made a separate post for my lippies , check it out here https://www.reddit.com/r/beautytalkph/s/8EfYDxKSZI

1cvgfes,"Recent Lippie Haul from Rom&nd & Peripera + Swatches Just wanted to share swatches of my recent 5.5 lippie haul just in case anyone else are eyeing some of these shades. 😘

For reference, I currently use the shade Light 02 ng Strokes Foundation or usually shade 23 ng korean foundations. My preference for lippies are mostly on the pink/peachy nudes, hence the products in this post. Haha.

**Rom&nd Glasting Color Gloss - Nutty Vague**
    - Thick consistency but very sheer, and a literal MLBB for those with warm-neutral undertones
    - Hides the lips' fine lines really well, gives you tanghulu lips fr; pigment doesn't sink into lines ~~unlike detail's glass stain~~
    - Volume of the gloss lasts really long and keeps your lips moisturized. Nawawala lang sya once you eat or drink just like any other gloss.
    - Doesn't leave a tint and doesn't get too deep even after multiple layers/ reapplication. Maybe a con for others but a positive to those who want to keep their lips muted/the same color.
    - Doesn't shift your base lip or lip liner under it.
    - Works well with JLTs for extra juicy-looking lips.

**Rom&nd Juicy Lasting Tint - Peach Honey B**
    - Can I just say this is the prettiest peach shade lippie I've ever encountered? This brand really takes their color theory very seriously. I think it's a pretty neutral peach tint that can work for warm-cooler undertones.
    - Same JLT formula, gives instant shine volume but it doesn't last as long as their Glasting Color Gloss or Peripera's Ink Mood Glowy Tints. Parang nagde-deflate sya through time, leaving the tint alone. This is why some people say na JLTs are drying for them, for me I consider the glossy finish dispersing or evaporating, even, through time.
    - Although the gloss doesn't last too long, it does leave a persistent tint that lasts almost through the day. Also, reapplying doesn't make the tint on your lips go any deeper than it's original shade, which I very much appreciate.
    - Slightly shifts around your base lip or lip liner if you apply this on top. 

**Peripera Ink Mood Glowy Tint - Nude Area**
    - Similar to 01 Best Beige Menu *(w/c was my previous fav btw)* but is slightly more nude. This has less red pigments compared to shade 01.
   - Same formula with their old IMG tints. Gloss comes up to the surface more, after a few minutes. As the tint pigments sets on your lips, the gloss lifts on the surface. Gloss volume lasts for hours until you eat or drink.
    - Doesn't ruin your base lip or lip liner underneath.

**Peripera Ink Velvet Tint - Pink Beige Nude**
    - Perfect description of color from it's name alone. It has a lot of white pigments so I don't think this would work on deeper skintones. It makes a really good lip base to layer with other deeper lippies for a gradiation look.
    - Comfortable formula esp. for a matte lippie. Can emphasize dry flaky skin on the lips though so best to use on well hydrated and exfoliated lips.
    - Makes for a really nice pinkish nude blush as well. Good for natural looks that's easy to slap on while on the go. I'll actually bring this on my company outing trip this week.
    - Leaves a persistent tint even for a muted color. Was pleasantly surprised it left a good tint after wiping / washing off.

**Peripera Ink Velvet Tint - Strawberry Nude**
    - I call this my barbie pink lippie as someone with neutral-warm undertone. Can be a little too cool for others though. I use this on days I feel extra girly and like to wear a pink look.
    - Looks good as blush as well.
    - Leaves a really long lasting stain. My hand and arm are still stained for swatching these even after washing several times.",https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1cvgfes,195,18,Swatches,peripera,international,"foundation, foundations, blush, lip liner",,2024-05-19,Neutral

1duj2od,"Lip oils: quick review Hi! I recently got into lip oils and wanted to share my thoughts on the seven products that I do have so far, hopefully to help girlies who are deciding between brands. My last purchase was last month and I do rotate pretty much daily.


1. Versed (shade Fig): My first one. Easy and clean lipbalm-like dispenser/applicator, which I think is my fave thing about it lol. Feels nice on the lips but slides off easily. Nothing about it really stands out I think, but it’s probably the best bang for your buck.

2. Dior (shade Raspberry): I’ve been using Dior’s lip glow since college and I’m thrilled they kept the sweet mint scent for the lip oils. Parang wala masyadong pH-reactiveness sa akin ‘to, but I like the hint of colour and how it feels. Dainty packaging but kinda feels flimsy cause it’s all plastic.

3. Rare Beauty (shade Hope): This is my entry to the RB brand and..I think I’m staying away hehe. Flattering shade for a cool fair skin like mine, and kita ko nga na it does leave a slight tint when it slides off. But for 3ml of product, with this quality, priced like so, it’s very easy to beat (and, can I say, overrated).

4. Tirtir (shade Honey clear): Binili ko lang din kasi gusto ko itry yung cushion foundation and moisturizer from the brand lol. This particular one smells like Yakult. Feels moisturizing AT FIRST but I’ve been using this before bed and I always wake up with parched lips. Went back to my usual bedtime lippie (Summer Fridays lip butter balm) and my lips went back to normal. Hay nako.

5. Hermès (shade Rose Pitaya): I know people tend to say you’re only paying for the brand, but this is my overall fave, and 8.5ml is up there. Smells like lychee which I don’t really mind but I think might irritate sensitive noses. A liiitle bit tacky feel, which means it doesn’t slide off easily. Leaves a tint as well.

6. Gisou (shade Strawberry Sorbet): Good colour payoff. It has a gel-like consistency like the Dior one, but this one leans on kind of the drying side, I think — like, it isn’t too bad, but if you tend to have chapped lips, I’d tell you to stay away from this one. Still, I lowkey want to try the sparkly pink shade (Watermelon Sugar).

7. Summer Fridays (shade Pink Cloud): I love the brand’s lip butter balms sooo much that I literally have six different shades of it. For that reason, I was let down by this lip oil. Fat tube with only 4.5ml of product, applicator that picks up too much, and mediocre shade range I think. Still feels moisturizing, but I really just expected more.


…That’s it from me! I definitely want to buy more, and will post a part 2 review if this gains visibility. I’ll do my best to respond to any questions. 🫶🏻",https://i.redd.it/8m7chky32cad1.jpeg,194,46,Review,cloud,local,"foundation, moisturizer",,2024-07-03,Neutral
tv6s5y,"Personal Experience: CO2 Fractional Laser and Revlite # CO2 Fractional Laser

- Price: ₱17k for 3 sessions

- Clinic: SkinStation

- Frequency: Once every 2 months

I have shallow acne scars (dents) on my skin which are not visible in photos but are visible in real life. It’s more visible when a certain angle of light hits my face so I don’t really like being under the sun or sitting close to someone at day time. 

It only took 2 sessions for my skin to return to its flat and normal state: plump, no dents and no shadows. 2 sessions lang pero matagal bago ko natapos because I spent time and effort to control my acne breakouts and identify what causes it. Hindi sulit magpa CO2 FL kapag may active pimples ka. The doctors can still perform CO2 FL but they will purposely avoid your pimples which is counter-intuitive for me because ayun nga yung area na dapat mas madaanan ng laser since it’s prone to breakout. Sabe dadami daw pimple pag na-distrub so pinapawala ko muna yung pimples bago mag schedule. Kahit isa lang tumubo, di ako natutuloy magpa CO2 FL. I will schedule a session and whenever a pimple pops up, I will cancel and reschedule so palagi ako kinakabahan kapag malapit na appointment ko kase baka ma-cancel na naman. 

*Before Treatment*

I was advised to stop using actives and peeling products for 5-7 days before the CO2 FL so my skin can rest a bit before the ablative procedure. In my case, I use tretinoin 0.05% thrice a week (MWF) so I always schedule for Thursday of the following week. 

*During Treatment*

Aesthetician cleaned my face, and applied topical anesthesia and let it sit for 30-45 minutes. After she removed the anesthesia, doctor started with the CO2 FL. You will smell burning hairs, you will feel multiple stings on your face and your tears will unintentionally come out. As someone na may mataas na pain tolerance, naramdaman ko pa rin yung discomfort from heat and the continuous “rubber band snaps” sensation. 

*After Treatment*

Doctor prescribed an oral medicine to take for 5 days to lessen the discomfort. Sa first session lang ako nag take nito akala ko kase required. Di naman sobra yung discomfort during the healing period to the point na nakakalimutan ko inumin kase parang wala na lang talaga yung pain. Di na ako nag take nung 2nd session. Kung mababa pain tolerance mo baka kailagan mo mag take ng oral medicine. 

Healing period or down time is 7 days. Pakiramdam ko non ang kapal kapal ng skin ko. I was advised to use only gentle products. From my point of understanding, gentle means alcohol-free, fragrance-free and does not contain actives. I already have good and working products so I just used them like usual. 

######AM/PM Skincare Products

- Cleanser: Hada Labo Foam Facial Wash

- Toner: Hada Labo Goku Jyun Premium Lotion

- Serum: Skinfood Royal Honey Propolis

- Moisturizer: Soon Jung 10-Free Moist Emulsion

- Sunscreen: Benton Air Fit UV Defense Sun Cream

- Oil Cleanser: DHC Cleansing Oil

######Day 1-3

Cleanser, moisturizer and sunscreen only. 

######Day 4

Added toner and serum in my routine. 

######Day 5

I started oil cleansing again. This is the point where gunks, old skin and the grid lines caused by CO2 FL will fall off revealing a baby smooth skin. Mararamdaman mo physically during oil cleansing yung mga nabakbak na skin. Mag oil cleanse lang kayo, wag nyo pipilitin tuklapin yung balat kase lalo mag brown/dark yan. Nangyare yon sa isang patient before me. Ayun yung reklamo nya. It turns out nagkukutkot sya kase patchy daw tignan pag naka makeup sya jusQ -_- sayang yung progress. Wag nyo pilitin. Parang love lang yan, mas maganda kapag hindi pinipilit. 

# Revlite

- Price: ₱15k for 3 sessions

- Clinic: Regenesis

- Frequency: Once every 6 weeks

I’ve been wanting to try Revlite for a few years now pero hindi natutuloy because I have focused on finishing my CO2 FL sessions and building a good skincare routine. 

Now that I’m done with CO2 FL, I decided to give Revlite a shot. There are new laser brands in the market but Revlite is still considered globally as the gold-standard Q-switched Nd:YAG laser. Even sa tattoo removal, Revlite pa rin gamit. Imagine what it can do to your dark spots.  

*Before Treatment*

Before you purchase a Revlite session/package, go to RevLite Philippines’ [website](https://www.revlite.ph) to check the certified clinics near you. Yes, may certification sila kase may mga fake and sub-standard facial lasers like “RevLight”. RevLite is also (USA) FDA approved so they have [documentations](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh_docs/pdf13/k133254.pdf) that you can read from the FDA site. 

RevLite’s website and messenger chat bot gave me the list of accredited clinics and I found 2 near me - Regenesis at Festival Mall and Wink Laser Studio at Alabang Town Center. I went to Regensis kase matagal na sila sa Festival Mall and they even survived pandemic. It just gave me the impression na marami siguro silang clients and maganda service. Mas mura din yung CO2 FL nila. 

The same with CO2 FL, stop using actives and peeling products days before the Revlite session. 

*During Treatment*

Aesthetician cleaned my face, and removed the blackheads and whiteheads. Doctor took some pictures of my skin and asked me several questions - period flow, PCOS, products I use, my goal with Revlite, etc. Baka daw kase ma-cure nga ng Revlite yung skin problems ko tapos may underlying problems pala ako, sayang daw sa pera. 

After that, doctor started with the Revlite, it has a similar sensation with CO2 FL but less painful. Pinadaanan muna ng laser yung whole face to rejuvenate the skin tapos binalikan yung area na may dark spots. Derma informed me that Revlite can remove hair like what diode laser does so she carefully avoided my brows but asked me if I want my upper lip hair removed. Of course I said yes, that’s one less diode laser to pay for. Sabe nya gigil daw sya sa hair talaga so inalis nya lahat ng pwede alisin. As someone who is balbon, na-appreciate ko yon. 

*After Treatment*

My face was red, facial hairs turned white but I did not feel any discomfort at all. They applied sunscreen and that’s it. They did not offer any product so I was surprised. Usually sa mga clinics, pilitin ka nila bumili ng products nila so that’s a plus for me. They just informed me that my current products are good. 

Down time for Revlite is less than a day.

Huda Easy Bake Loose Powder- best applied with a sponge! Ito mali ko nung una because I was using it with a big powder brush and was not seeing its effects. I use Pound Cake for undereyes and Banana Bread for the rest of the face as needed.

Tirtir Mask Fit Cushion- great coverage without feeling too heavy, not too matte nor dewy. I use 23N Sand. The pink variation is my newest purchase (di ko pa na buksan) so this review is for the OG red packaging.

1f5867e,"Small beauty haul It has been over half a year since I made any makeup and skin care purchase and it was time to restock on staples and try something new.

NARS Soft Matte Foundation - new to me but I like the finish - it’s matte but not flat and looks even better especially when it starts to mix with the natural oils on my face. Deauville is a perfect shade match and the only thing I do not like is that it dries pretty quickly.

RMK Liquid Foundation - a staple. I have been using this for over a decade now and I just keep repurchasing even if I have to order this from overseas. Shade 100 is a perfect shade match as well since I’m acidic and this one tends to oxidize just a little bit the moment I start to oil up. 

Tom Ford Traceless Perfecting Cushion - I like the liquid one better but I can no longer find it so I settled for this one instead. Still good but there are better cushions out there. 

Gucci Blush in Radiant Pink - while I do not find the compact luxurious compared to its counterparts, I just fell in love with the shade and the formula works well on my skin. And it smells so good that I find myself sniffing it whenever I use it. Odd but true.

Dior Backstage Face & Body Concealer - I like the consistency and texture of this concealer. It’s good if you just want light coverage. 

Nuxe Reve de Miel lip balm - a staple as well and my lips’ savior! I find this to be nourishing.

Estee Lauder ANR - another staple that I have been using for over a decade now. It is, by no means, a miracle product but it just works so well on my skin especially on those months when my cheeks get extra dry. My skin just feels so soft and smooth and it looks more “awake”, if that makes sense.

Clinique Moisture Surge - also have a decade-long relationship with this. It plumps up my skin and it feels so hydrated. I also apply this on my undereyes in lieu of an eye creams. I apply a second layer when my cheeks get extra dry during the colder months. I’ve strayed but I keep coming back to it.

MFK A La Rose - I’ve used up the 11ml bottle of this and made a pikit-mata purchase of the 35mL bottle. It’s like the perfect scent of rose for me. I’m not a huge fan of heavy florals as I find them to be migraine-inducing (I’m looking at you, V&R Flowebomb) but this is an exception. The dry down on my skin is lovely but it can get quite strong when sprayed on my clothes. I imagine a woman who has her life together yet fully embraces her femininity wearing that scent, sophisticated without being flamboyant wearing this scent (quite the opposite of me, really).

Hermes Un Jardin Sur Le Toit - got the 30mL bottle after using up the 15mL one. It smells fresh and somewhat citrusy but you get a hint of floral. I only spray this on my skin as the dry down ends up smelling like a guy when sprayed on my shirt. 

I no longer included the sheet masks I purchased as it will be too overcrowded 😬.

That’s all for now. I hope the mini reviews I included can help “budol” someone or decide against it. Have an amazing weekend!
